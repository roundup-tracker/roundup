"\n"
"All commands (except help) require a tracker specifier. This is just\n"
"the path to the roundup tracker you're working with. A roundup tracker\n"
"is where roundup keeps the database and configuration file that defines\n"
"an issue tracker. It may be thought of as the issue tracker's \"home\n"
"directory\". It may be specified in the environment variable TRACKER_HOME\n"
"or on the command line as \"-i tracker\".\n"
"\n"
"A designator is a classname and a nodeid concatenated, eg. bug1, user10, ...\n"
"\n"
"Property values are represented as strings in command arguments and in the\n"
"printed results:\n"
" . Strings are, well, strings.\n"
" . Date values are printed in the full date format in the local time zone,\n"
"   and accepted in the full format or any of the partial formats explained\n"
"   below.\n"
" . Link values are printed as node designators. When given as an argument,\n"
"   node designators and key strings are both accepted.\n"
" . Multilink values are printed as lists of node designators joined\n"
"   by commas.  When given as an argument, node designators and key\n"
"   strings are both accepted; an empty string, a single node, or a list\n"
"   of nodes joined by commas is accepted.\n"
"\n"
"When property values must contain spaces, just surround the value with\n"
"quotes, either ' or \". A single space may also be backslash-quoted. If a\n"
"value must contain a quote character, it must be backslash-quoted or inside\n"
"quotes. Examples:\n"
"           hello world      (2 tokens: hello, world)\n"
"           \"hello world\"    (1 token: hello world)\n"
"           \"Roch'e\" Compaan (2 tokens: Roch'e Compaan)\n"
"           Roch\\'e Compaan  (2 tokens: Roch'e Compaan)\n"
"           address=\"1 2 3\"  (1 token: address=1 2 3)\n"
"           \\\\               (1 token: \\)\n"
"           \\n\\r\\t           (1 token: a newline, carriage-return and tab)\n"
"\n"
"When multiple nodes are specified to the roundup get or roundup set\n"
"commands, the specified properties are retrieved or set on all the listed\n"
"nodes.\n"
"\n"
"When multiple results are returned by the roundup get or roundup find\n"
"commands, they are printed one per line (default) or joined by commas (with\n"
"the -c) option.\n"
"\n"
"Where the command changes data, a login name/password is required. The\n"
"login may be specified as either \"name\" or \"name:password\".\n"
" . ROUNDUP_LOGIN environment variable\n"
" . the -u command-line option\n"
"If either the name or password is not supplied, they are obtained from the\n"
"command-line.\n"
