Roundup has three web sites:

 * https://www.roundup-tracker.org/
 * https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/
 * https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/

www is hosted on SourceForge, issues is hosted on a python software
foundation host and wiki is hosted at waldman-edv.

updating services hosted on sf.net (www)
=================================================
Generic SF instructions for web service recommend
uploading files through SFTP, described here:
http://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Project%20Web%20Services/

However, SFTP is ugly to script in non-interactive
mode, so we use SSH access to fetch everything and
build from server side.

Working with sf.net
-------------------
Current docs are taken down with SourceForge Trac,
so working instructions are available from here:
http://web.archive.org/web/20140618231150/http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Shell%20service

    # log in, replace <user> with your account
    ssh -t <user>,roundup@shell.sourceforge.net create

    # set project_home
    project_home=/home/project-web/roundup

    # pull latest Roundup source with www and wiki
    hg pull -u --cwd ${project_home}/src/roundup
    # see below if this fails with: not trusting file
      # /home/project-web/roundup/src/roundup/.hg/hgrc from untrusted
      # user 110231, group 48

    # read up on other people changes and add yours
    cd ${project_home}
    vim logbuch.txt

[ Note: all the files in the project home except htdocs that make up
  the website were gone. I created a new logbuch.txt file. We need to
  build the docs outside the sourceforge envirnment and rsync them in
  as there is no longer a working sphinx environment. ]

If you get a "not trusting" error the problem is that the .hg files in
use are not owned by you and hg won't use them. Add this to your
~/.hgrc file (create file if needed)

[trusted]
groups=48
users=110231

if the uid/gid changes you may have to change the values.
See: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Trust for details

When done working in the sf shell, you can destroy it early
to free resources:

    shutdown

updating www.roundup-tracker.org
---------------------------------
Note that sourceforge still only has python2 available on it's
systems. Doc updates probably need to be done by building on local
machine using modern Sphinx (7.x or greater) and the generated files
pushed to the website.

Also the files htdocs/ahref* and htdocs/google* have to be copied from
the current production tree to the new directory so we keep some level
of analytics.

-----

Site update requires rebuilding HTML files. For that
`sphinx` is required/
Hopefully, it is already installed into virtualenv, so
the whole procedure looks like so:

    # activate the virtualenv
    . ${project_home}/docbuilder/bin/activate
    # cd to website source and build it
    cd ${project_home}/src/roundup/website/www
    hg up <release tag>  # make sure you are using the released code
    make clean
    make html
    # you can check which files updated (the date will change with many files)
    #diff -ur --brief ${project_home}/htdocs/ ./html/
    # copy to website dir
    cp -r -p ./html/* ${project_home}/htdocs/
    # copy legacy html doc to website docs/ dir
    # (in main doc/conf.py this is done automatically)
    cp -r -p ../../doc/html_extra/* ${project_home}/htdocs/docs/
    # or try it with rsync (skip --dry-run when ready)
    #rsync --dry-run -v --checksum --recursive ./html/* ${project_home}/htdocs/


If you are releasing an alpha/beta release, don't update:

 ${project_home}/htdocs/docs/

instead update:

  ${project_home}/htdocs/dev-docs/

and the URL will be: https://www.roundup-tracker.org/dev-docs/docs.html

Note there appears to be a cache somewhere in the path, so you may
need to use:

  https://www.roundup-tracker.org/dev-docs/docs.html?foo=1

to cache bust.

Updating issues.roundup-tracker.org
===================================

The tracker resides on bugs.ams1.psf.io (188.166.48.69). You can also
ssh to issues.roundup-tracker.org. They have the same fingerprint:

    ED25519 key fingerprint is f1:f7:3d:bf:3b:01:8d:e1:4e:30:b3:0f:6e:98:b8:9b.

The roundup installation belongs to the user roundup. 
The setup uses virtualenv. Use the python version:

  /srv/roundup/env/bin/python2.7

to get a python with roundup on the PYTHONPATH.

The Roundup tracker https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/ is in
/srv/roundup/trackers/roundup/ with the database set to
/srv/roundup/data/roundup/. Note that postgres is used for the
backend, so the database directory above is used for msgs and files.

Source is in: /srv/roundup/src/

Roundup is run using gunicorn and wsgi.

You have 'sudo -u roundup' access if you need to run things as the
roundup user.

The configuration is tracked in multiple places.
The one used by PSF infrastrcuture is:

   https://github.com/psf/bpo-tracker-roundup

Contact ee-durbin (or psf infra) for an invite to their repo.

Usually testing is done with: the "website/issues" section
of Roundup's Mercurical SCM repository and copied manually to the live
tracker.

  * get a working copy of roundup/website/issues from the SCM, either via
        hg clone https://hg.code.sf.net/p/roundup/code
    or download a snapshot:
        https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/default/tarball

  * check the differences
      diff -ur /srv/roundup/trackers/roundup/ roundup/website/issues/

Copy differences using 'sudo -u roundup ...' into production for testing.

Restart the server with:

 sudo service roundup-roundup restart

The git version is what PSF uses if they have to rebuild/move our
tracker. So it's important to keep it up to date.

They also generate the config.ini from an ansible script. So if you
need to change settings in config.ini (e.g. logging from ERROR to
WARNING) and have it persist across (daily+) ansible runs you need to
update:

 pillar/base/bugs.sls

in the https://github.com/python/psf-salt repo and then push it.

Getting a user account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get access to the host, submit a pull request for:

    https://github.com/python/psf-salt

by forking the repo, make a change similar to:

    https://github.com/rouilj/psf-salt/commit/2aa55d0fc5a343f45f5507437d3fba077cbaf852

and submit it as a pull request. Contact ewdurbin via #roundup IRC or by
adding an issue to the master psf-salt repo.


updating wiki.roundup-tracker.org
=================================
Wiki isn't hosted on sourceforge anymore. See:

 https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2551045

for details on Implementing wiki move to Waldmann-EDV.

Contact Thomas Waldmann. Web site: https://www.waldmann-edv.de/
email: info AT waldmann-edv DOT de.

The sites theme is under wiki/wiki/data/plugin/theme/roundup.py.  Last
updated by emailing Thomas 2/2021. Images/icons and css under
wiki/_static.

Backups are assumed to be done by Waldmann-edv. There does not appear
to be a way to get access to the underlying filesystem via ssh or to
do a backup/tarball via with web.

DNS
===
Thomas Waldman is also our DNS manager. All changes should go to him
at email: info AT waldmann-edv DOT de.

Richard Jones still owns/pays for the roundup-tracker.org domain.
It expires on: 2026-01-06T10:49:58Z.
