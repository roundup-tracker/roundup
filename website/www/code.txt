        Information for developers of Roundup. Including directions on
        checking code from repository, how to run demo mode and
        execute tests.

Code
====

Project history is maintained in `CHANGES.txt <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/tip/tree/CHANGES.txt>`_
file in code repository of Roundup, which can also be viewed online
through SourceForge `web interface <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/default/tree/>`_.

Get sources
-----------

Official **read-only access** to Mercurial repository is provided through ::

  hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/roundup/code roundup

**Read/write access** requires SSH password or SSH key
authorization (see `SourceForge.net docs for details
<https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Mercurial/>`_) ::

  hg clone ssh://USERNAME@hg.code.sf.net/p/roundup/code roundup

You also need to be added as a Roundup developer for write access -
ask for it on the :doc:`roundup-devel list <contact>`.

You can also use the Roundup mirror on GitHub. It lags behind the
Mercurial repository, but is usually only a couple of weeks old. You
can clone it using::

   git clone https://github.com/roundup-tracker/roundup.git

Note that even though we have a mirror on GitHub we don't use Issues
(use https://issues.roundup-tracker.org) or Pull requests. The GitHub
mirror is used for CI.

Run demo
--------

Roundup doesn't need any dependencies and works out of the box. Demo
is accessible at http://localhost:8917/demo/ by default ::

  cd roundup
  python demo.py

Execute tests
-------------
::

  python -m pytest test

See repository `README.txt <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/tip/tree/README.txt>`_
for more info.
