2001-07-11 - 0.1.0
 . Needed a bug tracking system. Looked around. Tried to install many
   Perl-based systems, to no avail. Got tired of waiting for Roundup to be
   released. Had just finished major product project, so needed something
   different for a while. Roundup here I come...


2001-07-18 - 0.1.1
 . Initial version release with consent of Roundup spec author, Ka-Ping Yee:
   "Amazing!  Nice work.  I'll watch for the source code on your website."


2001-07-18 - 0.1.2
 . Set default index to ?:group=priority&:columns=activity,status,title so
   the priority column isn't displayed.
 . Thanks Anthony:
   . added notes to the README about Python prerequisites
   . added check to roundup.py, roundup.cgi, server.py and roundup-mailgw.py
     for python 2+ - and made the file itself parseable by 1.5.2 ;)
   . python 2.0 didn't have the default args for the time module functions.
   . better handling of db directory in initDB
 . Sorting on the extra properties defined by roundupdb classes was broken
   due to the caching used. May now sort on activity and creation
   properties, etc.
 . Set the default index to sort on activity


2001-07-19 - 0.1.3
 . Reldate now takes an argument "pretty" - when true, it pretty-prints the
   interval generated up to 5 days, then pretty-prints the date of last
   activity. The issue index and item now use the pretty format.
 . Classes list for admin user in CGI interface.
 . Made the view configuration more accessible, neater and more realistic.
 . Fixed list view grouping handling grouping by a Multilink or String or Link
   value of None or Date, ...  (mind you, sorting by Date???)
 . Fixed bug in the plain formatter when a Link was None.
 . Fixed ordering of list view column headings.
 . Fixed list view column heading sort links - and limited the number of
   columns to sort by to 2.
 . Added searching by glob to StringType filtering -
    ^text  - search for text at start of fields
    text$  - search for text at end of fields
    ^text$ - exactly match text in fields
    te*xt  - search for text matching "te"<any characters>"xt"
    te?xt  - search for text matching "te"<any one character>"xt"
 . Added more fields to the issue.filter and issue.index templates


2001-07-19 - 0.1.4
 . Fixed bug in re generation in the filter (I hadn't finished the code ;)
 . Fixed handling of None String property in grouped list headings
 . Fixed adding new issue with no change note
 . Added an issue priority of support
 . Fixed values in text input fields which contained quotes (") are now
   quoted.
 . Fixed a bug in the hyperdb filter - wrong variable names in the error
   message.
 . Major reshuffle of code to allow multiple roundup instances and a
   single, site-packages -based installation. Also allows multiple database
   back-ends.
 . Moved the bin/ proggies into the top dir, so that it all works
   out-of-the-box
 . Added the "classic" template - a direct implementation of the Roundup
   spec. Well, as close as we're going to get, anyway.
 . Added command-line arg handling to roundup-server so it's more useful 
   out-of-the-box.
