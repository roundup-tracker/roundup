def token_split(s, whitespace=' \r\n\t', quotes='\'"',
                escaped={'r': '\r', 'n': '\n', 't': '\t'}):
    r'''Split the string up into tokens. An occurence of a ``'`` or ``"`` in
    the input will cause the splitter to ignore whitespace until a matching
    quote char is found. Embedded non-matching quote chars are also skipped.

    Whitespace and quoting characters may be escaped using a backslash.
    ``\r``, ``\n`` and ``\t`` are converted to carriage-return, newline and
    tab.  All other backslashed characters are left as-is.

    Valid examples::

           hello world      (2 tokens: hello, world)
           "hello world"    (1 token: hello world)
           "Roch'e" Compaan (2 tokens: Roch'e Compaan)
           Roch\'e Compaan  (2 tokens: Roch'e Compaan)
           address="1 2 3"  (1 token: address=1 2 3)
           \\               (1 token: \)
           \n               (1 token: a newline)
           \o               (1 token: \o)

    Invalid examples::

           "hello world     (no matching quote)
           Roch'e Compaan   (no matching quote)
