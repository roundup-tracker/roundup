       This decorator is applied to an entry point for a request.

       points. As a result, this decorator can be called multiple
       times as some entry points can traverse another entry point
       used by a different invocation method. It will not set a
       trace_id if one is already assigned.

       A uuid4() is used as the uuid, but to shorten the log line,
       the uuid4 integer is encoded into a 62 character ascii
       alphabet (A-Za-z0-9).

       This decorator may produce duplicate (colliding) trace_id's
       when used with multiple processes on some platforms where
       uuid.uuid4().is_safe is unknown. Probability of a collision
