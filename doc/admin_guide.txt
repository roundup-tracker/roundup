What does Roundup install?
==========================

There's two "installations" that we talk about when using Roundup:

1. The installation of the software and its support files. This uses the
   standard Python mechanism called "setuptools" and thus Roundup's core code,
   executable scripts and support data files are installed in Python's
   directories. On Windows, this is typically:

   Scripts
     ``<python dir>\scripts\...``
   Core code
     ``<python dir>\lib\site-packages\roundup\...``
   Support files
     ``<python dir>\share\roundup\...``

   and on Unix-like systems (eg. Linux):

   Scripts
     ``<python root>/bin/...``
   Core code
     ``<python root>/lib-<python version>/site-packages/roundup/...``
   Support files
     ``<python root>/share/roundup/...``

2. The installation of a specific tracker. When invoking the roundup-admin
   "inst" (and "init") commands, you're creating a new Roundup tracker. This
   installs configuration files, HTML templates, detector code and a new
   database. You have complete control over where this stuff goes through
   both choosing your "tracker home" and the ``main`` -> ``database`` variable
   in the tracker's config.ini.


Configuring Roundup's Logging of Messages For Sysadmins
=======================================================

You may configure where Roundup logs messages in your tracker's config.ini
file. Roundup will use the standard Python (2.3+) logging implementation.

Configuration for standard "logging" module:
 - tracker configuration file specifies the location of a logging
   configration file as ``logging`` -> ``config``
 - ``roundup-server`` specifies the location of a logging configuration
   file on the command line
Configuration for "BasicLogging" implementation:
 - tracker configuration file specifies the location of a log file
   ``logging`` -> ``filename``
 - tracker configuration file specifies the level to log to as
   ``logging`` -> ``level``
 - ``roundup-server`` specifies the location of a log file on the command
   line
 - ``roundup-server`` specifies the level to log to on the command line

(``roundup-mailgw`` always logs to the tracker's log file)

In both cases, if no logfile is specified then logging will simply be sent
to sys.stderr with only logging of ERROR messages.


Configuring roundup-server
==========================

The basic configuration file is as follows (taken from the
``roundup-server.ini.example`` file in the "doc" directory)::

  [main]

  # Host name of the Roundup web server instance.
  # If left unconfigured (no 'host' setting) the default
  # will be used.
  # If empty, listen on all network interfaces.
  # If you want to explicitly listen on all
  # network interfaces, the address 0.0.0.0 is a more
  # explicit way to achieve this, the use of an empty
  # string for this purpose is deprecated and will go away
  # in a future release.
  # Default: localhost
  host = localhost

  # Port to listen on.
  # Default: 8080
  port = 8017

  # Path to favicon.ico image file.  If unset, built-in favicon.ico is used.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: favicon.ico
  favicon = favicon.ico

  # User ID as which the server will answer requests.
  # In order to use this option, the server must be run initially as root.
  # Availability: Unix.
  # Default: 
  user = roundup

  # Group ID as which the server will answer requests.
  # In order to use this option, the server must be run initially as root.
  # Availability: Unix.
  # Default: 
  group = 

  # Maximum number of children to spawn using fork multiprocess mode.
  # Default: 40
  max_children = 40

  # don't fork (this overrides the pidfile mechanism)'
  # Allowed values: yes, no
  # Default: no
  nodaemon = no

  # Log client machine names instead of IP addresses (much slower)
  # Allowed values: yes, no
  # Default: no
  log_hostnames = no

  # Have http(s) request logging done via python logger module.
  # If set to yes the python logging module is used with qualname
  # 'roundup.http'. Otherwise logging is done to stderr or the file
  # specified using the -l/logfile option.
  # Allowed values: yes, no
  # Default: no
  loghttpvialogger = no

  # File to which the server records the process id of the daemon.
  # If this option is not set, the server will run in foreground
  # 
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: 
  pidfile = 

  # Log file path.  If unset, log to stderr.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: 
  logfile = 

  # Set processing of each request in separate subprocess.
  # Allowed values: debug, none, thread, fork.
  # Default: fork
  multiprocess = fork

  # Tracker index template. If unset, built-in will be used.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: 
  template = 

  # Enable SSL support (requires pyopenssl)
  # Allowed values: yes, no
  # Default: no
  ssl = no

  # PEM file used for SSL. A temporary self-signed certificate
  # will be used if left blank.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: 
  pem = 

  # Comma separated list of extra headers that should
  # be copied into the CGI environment.
  # E.G. if you want to access the REMOTE_USER and
  # X-Proxy-User headers in the back end,
  # set to the value REMOTE_USER,X-Proxy-User.
  # Allowed values: comma-separated list of words
  # Default: 
  include_headers = 

  # Change to HTTP/1.0 if needed. This disables keepalive.
  # Default: HTTP/1.1
  http_version = HTTP/1.1

  # Roundup trackers to serve.
  # Each option in this section defines single Roundup tracker.
  # Option name identifies the tracker and will appear in the URL.
  # Option value is tracker home directory path.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  [trackers]

  demo = /trackers/demo
  sysadmin = /trackers/sysadmin

Additional notes for each keyword:

**template**
  Specifies a template used for displaying the tracker index when
  multiple trackers are being used. It is processed by TAL and
  the variable "trackers" is available to the template and is a
  dict of all configured trackers.
**ssl**
  Enables use of SSL to secure the connection to the
  roundup-server. In most cases, you will want to run a
  real web server (Apache, Nginx) as a proxy to
  roundup-server running without SSL.  The real web server
  can filter/rate limit/firewall requests to roundup-server.
  If you enable this, ensure that your tracker's config.ini specifies
  an *https* URL. See roundup-server.1 man page for
  additional information.
**pem**
  If specified, the SSL PEM file containing the private key and certificate.
  The file must include both the private key and certificate with appropriate
  headers (e.g. ``-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----``,
  ``-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`` and
  ``-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----``,
  ``-----END CERTIFICATE-----``.
  If not specified, roundup will generate a temporary, self-signed certificate
  for use.
**trackers** section
  Each line denotes a mapping from a URL component to a tracker home.
  Make sure the name part doesn't include any url-unsafe characters like
  spaces. Stick to alphanumeric characters and you'll be ok.

To generate a config.ini in the current directory from the
roundup-server command line use::

 roundup_server -p 8017  -u roundup --save-config  demo=/trackers/demo \
    sysadmin=/trackers/sysadmin

Note it will save an old config.ini file to config.bak and create a
new config.ini. The file is recreated from scratch ignoring the
contents of the current config.ini. You may need to merge the backup
and config files. save-config doesn't attempt to load or verify an
existing config.ini. Running this in a tracker home directory will
move the exsiting config.ini to config.bak and replace it with the
roundup-server's config.ini. This will make the tracker in the
directory fail to start util the original config.ini is restored.

.. _configuring-compression:

Configuring Compression
=======================

Roundup will compress HTTP responses to clients on the fly. Dynamic,
on the fly, compression is enabled by default, to disable it set::

    [web]
    ...
    dynamic_compression = No

in the tracker's ``config.ini``. You should disable compression if
your proxy (e.g. nginx or apache) or wsgi server (uwsgi) is configured
to compress responses on the fly. The python standard library includes
gzip support. For brotli or zstd you will need to install packages. See
the `installation documentation`_ for details.

.. index:: single: interfaces.py; configuring http compression

Some assets will not be compressed on the fly. Assets with mime types
of "image/png" or "image/jpeg" will not be compressed. You
can add mime types to the list by using ``interfaces.py`` as discussed
in the `customisation documentation`_. As an example adding::

  from roundup.cgi.client import Client

  Client.precompressed_mime_types.append('application/zip`)

to ``interfaces.py`` will prevent zip files from being compressed.

Any content less than 100 bytes in size will not be compressed (e.g
errors messages, short json responses).

Zstd will be used if the client can understand it, followed by brotli
then gzip encoding. Currently the preference order is hard coded into
the server and not parsed using ``q`` values from the client's
Accept-Encoding header. This is an area for improvement.

In addition to dynamic compression, static files/assets accessed using
``@@file`` can be pre-compressed. This reduces CPU load on the server
and reduces the time required to respond to the client. By default
searching for pre-compressed files is disabled. To enable it set::

    [web]
    ...
    use_precompressed_files = Yes

in the tracker's ``config.ini`` file. Then you can create a
precompressed file and it will be served if the client is able to
accept it. For a file ``.../@@file/library.js`` you can create::

    tracker_home/html/library.js.gzip
    tracker_home/html/library.js.br
    tracker_home/html/library.js.zstd

which should be created by using (respectively)::

      gzip --keep --suffix .gzip library.js
      brotli library.js
      zstd library.js && mv library.js.zst library.js.zstd

see the man pages for options that control compression level. Note
that some levels require additional memory on the client side, so you
may not always want to use the highest compression available.

A pre-compressed file will not be used if its modified date is earlier
than the uncompressed file. For example, if ``library.js.gzip`` is
older (has earlier modification date) than ``library.js``,
``library.js.gzip`` will be ignored. ``library.js`` will be
served instead.  ``library.js`` will be dynamically compressed on the
fly and a warning message will be logged.

Precompressed files override dynamic compression. For example, assume
the client can accept brotli and gzip. If there are no precompressed
files, the data will be compressed dynamically (on the fly) using
brotli. If there is a precompressed gzip file present the client will
get the gzip version and not a brotli compressed version. This
mechanism allows the admin to allow use of brotli and zstd for
dynamic content, but not for static content.

.. index:: single: interfaces.py; setting REST maximum result limit

Configuring REST Maximum Result Limit
=====================================

To prevent denial of service (DOS) and limit user wait time for an
unbounded request, the REST endpoint has a maximum limit on the number
of rows that can be returned. By default, this is set to 10 million.
This setting applies to all users of the REST interface. If you want
to change this limit, you can add the following code to the
``interfaces.py`` file in your tracker::

    # change max response rows
    from roundup.rest import RestfulInstance
    RestfulInstance.max_response_row_size = 26

This code will set the maximum number of rows to 25 (one less than the
value). Note that this setting is rarely used and is not available in
the tracker's ``config.ini`` file. Setting it through this mechanism
allows you to enter a string or number that may break Roundup, such as
"asdf" or 0. In general, it is recommended to keep the limit at its
default value. However, this option is available for cases when a
request requires more than 10 million rows and pagination using
``@page_index`` and ``@page_size=9999999`` is not possible.

Adding a Web Content Security Policy (CSP)
==========================================

A Content Security Policy (`CSP`_) adds a layer of security to
Roundup's web interface. It makes it more difficult for an
attacker to compromise Roundup.  By default Roundup does not add
a CSP. If you need to implement a CSP, this section will help you
understand how to add one and document the current level of
support for CSP in Roundup.

Roundup's web interface has remained mostly unchanged since it
was created over a decade ago. Current releases have been slowly
modernizing the HTML to improve security. There are still some
improvements that need to happen before the tightest CSP
configurations can be used.

Writing a CSP is complex.  This section just touches on how to
create and install a CSP to improve security. Some of it might
break functionality.

There are two ways to add a CSP:

1. a fixed CSP added by a server
2. a dynamic CSP added by Roundup

Fixed CSP
---------

If you are using a web server (Apache, Nginx) to run Roundup, you can
add a ``Content-Security-Policy`` header using that server. WSGI
servers like uWSGI can also be configured to add headers.  An example
header would look like::

  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'strict-dynamic';

One thing that may need to be included is the ``unsafe-inline``.
The default templates use ``onload``, ``onchange``, ``onsubmit``,
and ``onclick`` JavaScript handlers. Without ``unsafe-inline``
these won't work and popup helpers will not work. Sadly the use
of ``unsafe-inline`` is a pretty big hole in this CSP.  You can
set the hashes for all the JavaScript handlers in the CSP. Then
replace ``unsafe-inline`` with ``unsafe-hashes`` to help close
this hole, but has its own issues. See `remediating
unsafe-inline`_ for another way to mitigate this.

The inclusion of ``strict-dynamic`` allows trusted JavaScript
files that are downloaded from Roundup to make changes to the web
interface. These changes are also trusted code that will be run
when invoked.

More secure CSPs can also be created. However because of the ability
to customise the web interface, it is difficult to provide guidance.

Dynamic CSP
-----------

Roundup creates a cryptographic nonce for every client request. The
nonce is the value of the ``client.client_nonce`` property.

By changing the templates to use the nonce, we can better secure the 
Roundup instance. However the nonce has to be set in the CSP returned
by Roundup.

One way to do this is to add a templating utility to the extensions
directory that generates the CSP on the fly. For example::

    default_security_headers = {
	'Content-Security-Policy': (
	    "default-src 'self'; "
	    "base-uri 'self'; "
	    "script-src https: 'nonce-{nonce}' 'strict-dynamic'; "
	    "style-src 'self' 'nonce-{nonce}'; "
	    "img-src 'self' data:; "
	    "frame-ancestors 'self'; "
	    "object-src 'self' 'nonce-{nonce}'; "
	),
    }


    def AddHtmlHeaders(client, header_dict=None):
	''' Generate https headers from dict use default security headers

	    Setting the header with a value of None will not inject the
	    header and can override the default set.

	    Header values will be formatted with a dictionary including a
	    nonce. Use to set a nonce for inline scripts.
	'''
	try:
	    if client.client_nonce is None:
		# logger.warning("client_nonce is None")
		client.client_nonce = client.session_api._gen_sid()
	except AttributeError:
	    # client.client_nonce doesn't exist, create it
	    # logger.warning("client_nonce does not exist, creating")
	    client.client_nonce = client.session_api._gen_sid()

	headers = default_security_headers.copy()
	if isinstance(header_dict, dict):
            headers.update(header_dict)

	client_headers = client.additional_headers

	for header, value in list(headers.items()):
	    if value is None:
		continue
	    client_headers[header] = value.format(
                nonce=client.client_nonce)

    def init(instance):
        instance.registerUtil('AddHtmlHeaders', AddHtmlHeaders)


Adding the following to ``page.html`` right after the opening
``<html....`>`` tag::

   <tal:code tal:content="python:utils.AddHtmlHeaders(request.client)" />

will invoke ``AddHtmlHeaders()`` to add the CSP header with the nonce.

With this set of CSP headers, all style, script and object tags will
need a ``nonce`` attribute. This can be added by changing::

    <script src="javascript.js"></script>

to::

    <script
        tal:attributes="nonce request/client/client_nonce"
        src="javascript.js"></script>

for each script, object or style tag.

Remediating ``unsafe-inline``
-----------------------------
.. _remediating unsafe-inline:

Using a trusted script to set event handlers to replace the ``onX``
handlers allows removal of the ``unsafe-inline`` handlers.  If you
remove ``unsafe-inline`` the ``onX`` handlers will not run. However
you can use the label provided by the ``onX`` attribute to securely
enable a callback function.

This method is a work in progress. As an example proof of concept,
adding this "decorator" script at the end of page.html::

   <script tal:attributes="nonce request/client/client_nonce">
    /* set submit event listener on forms that have an
    onsubmit (case insensitive) attribute */
    forms = document.querySelectorAll(form[onsubmit])
    for (let form of f) {
        form.addEventListener('submit',
                              () => submit_once());
     };
   </script>

will set callback for the submit even on any form that has an onsubmit
attribute to ``submit_once()``. ``submit_once`` is defined in Roundup's
base_javascript and is generated with a proper nonce.

By including the nonce in the dynamic CSP, we can use our trusted
"decorator" script to add event listeners. These listeners will call
the trusted function in base_javascript to replace the ignored ``onX``
handlers.

Classhelper Web Component
=========================

Version 2.4.0 provides a new classhelper popup written as a web
component. By installing 3 files and editing the tracker's templates
you can enable the new component.

The `development of this component was done by team-03
<https://github.com/UMB-CS-682-Team-03/tracker>`_ of the
Spring 2024 CS682 graduate software engineering SDL capstone
class at the University of Massachusetts - Boston. Their
documentation is copied/adapted below.

File Installation
-----------------

There are three files to install in your tracker. You can
copy them from the template directory for the classic
tracker. The location of the template file can be obtained
by running: ``roundup-admin templates`` and looking for the
path value of the classic template. If the path value is
``/path/to/template``, copy::

 /path/to/template/html/classhelper.js
 /path/to/template/html/classhelper.css
 /path/to/template/html/_generic.translation

to your tracker's html directory.

Wrapping the Classic Classhelper
--------------------------------

To allow your users to select items in the web interface
using the new classhelper, you should edit the template files
in the ``html/`` subdirectory of your tracker. Where you see
code like::

 <th i18n:translate="">Superseder</th>
  <td>
    <span tal:replace="structure
          python:context.superseder.field(showid=1,size=20)" />
    <span tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok"
	  tal:replace="structure
	               python:db.issue.classhelp('id,title',
		       property='superseder', pagesize=100)" />
     [...]
 </td>

change it to wrap the classhelp span like this::

 <th i18n:translate="">Superseder</th>
  <td>
    <span tal:replace="structure
          python:context.superseder.field(showid=1,size=20)" />
    <roundup-classhelper
      data-popup-title="Superseder Classhelper - {itemDesignator}"
      data-search-with="title,status,keyword[]-name">
      <span tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok"
	    tal:replace="structure
                         python:db.issue.classhelp('id,title',
                         property='superseder', pagesize=100)" />
    </roundup-classhelper>
     [...]
 </td>

which displays a three part classhelper.

  1. the search pane includes a text search box for the `title`
     and `status` properties and a dropdown for the keyword property,
     sorted by name in descending order.
  2. the selection pane will show 100 search results per page.
     It also allows the user to move to the next or previous result
     page.
  3. the accumulator at the bottom shows all the selected items. It
     also has buttons to accept the items or cancel the
     classhelper, leaving the original page unchanged.

Note that the user class is a little different because users without
an Admin role can't search for a user by Role. So we hide the Role
search element for non admin users. Starting with::

  <th i18n:translate="">Nosy List</th>
  <td>
    <span tal:replace="structure context/nosy/field" />
    <span tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok" tal:replace="structure
	  python:db.user.classhelp('username,realname,address',
	  property='nosy', width='600'" />
  </td>

wrap the classhelp span with ``<roundup-classhelper>`` like::

  <th i18n:translate="">Nosy List</th>
  <td>
    <span tal:replace="structure context/nosy/field" />
    <roundup-classhelper tal:define="search string:name,phone,roles[]"
			 tal:attributes="data-search-with python:search
			 if request.user.hasRole('Admin') else
			 ','.join(search.split(',')[:-1])">
      <span tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok" tal:replace="structure
	    python:db.user.classhelp('username,realname,address',
	    property='nosy', width='600'" />
    </roundup-classhelper>
  </td>

The ``','.join(search.split(',')[:-1])`` removes the last element of
the search string (``roles[]``) if the user does not have the Admin
role.

Loading the <roundup-classhelper> Script
----------------------------------------

To make the ``<roundup-classhelper>`` wrappers work, you
have to load the classhelper.js script. Add the following
html script tag in the head section of page.html::

  <script type="text/javascript" src="@@file/classhelper.js">
  </script>

You can place it anywhere before ``</head>``. This will make
it available on all pages.

The script will also work if it is loaded at the end of the
body. It can also be added to the ``more-javascript`` slot
in one of the templates (see ``user.item.html`` for an
example) if you don't want the overhead of loading the script
on every page.

You may want to minimize and precompress the file. Using
dynamic compression, the file is 10k when compressed with
gzip (8k with brotli). If you minimize the file first with
`rjsmin <https://pypi.org/project/rjsmin/>`_ and then
compress it, it's about 6k. See the information about using
precompressed files in the :ref:`section on compression
<configuring-compression>`.

<roundup-classhelper> configuration
-----------------------------------

There are two attributes used to configure the classhelper.

data-popup-title:
  * this attribute is optional. A reasonable default is
    provided if it is missing.
  * Adding ``data-popup-title`` changes the title of the popup
    window with the value of the attribute.
  * ``{itemDesignator}`` can be used inside the attribute value
    to replace it with the current classhelper usage context.
    E.G. ``data-popup-title="Nosy List Classhelper - {itemDesignator}"``
    will display the popup window title as ``Nosy List Classhelper - issue24``

data-search-with:
  * this attribute is optional. If it is not set, a search
    panel is not created to allow the user to search within
    the class.
  * Adding ``data-search-with`` specifies the fields that can
    be used for searching. For example when invoking the
    classhelper for the issue class, using
    ``data-search-with="title,status,keyword"`` wil enable
    three search fields.
  * The search can be customized using the following syntax:

    * Adding ``[]`` at then end of a field (``"status[]"``)
      will displays a dropdown for the "status" field
      listing all the values the user can access. E.G.::

         <roundup-classhelper
             data-search-with="title,status[],keyword[]">
           <span tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok"
             tal:replace="structure
             python:db.issue.classhelp('id,title',
             property='superseder', pagesize=100)" />
         </roundup-classhelper>

      will create a search pane with a text search for title
      and dropdowns for status and keyword.

    * Adding a sort key after the ``[]`` allows you to
      select the order of the elements in the dropdown. For
      example ``keyword[]+name`` sorts the keyword
      dropdown in ascending order by name. While
      ``keyword[]-name`` sorts the keyword dropdown in
      descending order by name. If the sort order is not
      specified, the default order for the class is used.

<roundup-classhelper> styling
-----------------------------

The roundup-classhelper component uses minimal styling so it
can blend in with most trackers. If you want to change the
styling, you can modify the classhelper.css file in the html
directory. Even though roundup-classhelper is a web
component, it doesn't use the shadow DOM. If you don't know
what this means, it just means that it's easy to style.

Getting the web component to load changes to the css file is
a bit tricky. The browser caches the old file and you have
to resort to tricks to make it get a new copy of the file.

One way to do this is to open to the ``classhelper.css``
file in your browser and force refresh it. To do this:

   1. Open the home page for your Roundup issue tracker in a
      web browser.

   2. In the address bar, append ``@@file/classhelper.css``
      to the end of your Roundup URL. For example, if your
      Roundup URL is ``https://example.com/tracker/``, the
      URL you should visit would be
      ``https://example.com/tracker/@@file/classhelper.css``.

   3. This will open the `classhelper.css` file in your browser.

   4. Press ``Ctrl+Shift+R`` (on Windows and Linux) or
      ``Cmd+Shift+R`` (on macOS). This triggers a hard
      refresh of the page, which forces the browser to
      reload the file and associated resources from the
      server.

This should resolve any issues caused by cached or outdated
files. It is possible that you have to open devtools and set
the disable cache option in the network panel in extreme
cases.

Also during development, you might want to `set a very low
cache time
<customizing.html#changing-cache-control-headers>`_ for
classhelper.css using something like::

   Client.Cache_Control['classhelper.css'] = "public, max-age=10"


Translations
------------

To set up translations for the <roundup-classhelper>
component, follow these steps.

  1. Create a ``messages.pot`` file by running
     ``roundup-gettext <tracker_home_directory>``. This
     creates ``locale/messages.pot`` in your tracker's home
     directory. It extracts all translatable strings from
     your tracker. We will use it as a base template for the
     new strings you want to translate.
  2. See if you already have a ``.po`` translation file for
     your language in the tracker's locale/ directory. If you
     don't, copy ``messages.pot`` to a .po file for the
     language you want to translate. For example German
     would be at ``de.po`` English would be at ``en.po``
     (for example if you want to change the ``apply`` button
     to say ``Do It``.

  3. Edit the new .po file. After the header, add the
     translation entries for the <roundup-classhelper>
     component. For example `next` and `submit` are
     displayed in English when the rest of the interface is
     in German. Add::

        msgid "submit"
        msgstr "gehen"

        msgid "next"
        msgstr "nächste"

        msgid "name"
        msgstr "name"

     Note: the value for `msgid` is case sensitive. You can
     see the msgid for static strings by looking for
     ``CLASSHELPER_TRANSLATION_KEYWORDS`` in classhelper.js.

  4. Save the .po file.

  5. Restart your Roundup instance.

This should display the missing translations, for more
details refer to the `translation (i18n) section of the
developers documentation
<developers.html#extracting-translatable-messages>`_.

The default title used for read only popups can be changed by using
the translation mechanism. Use the following::

  msgid "Info on {className} - {itemDesignator} - Classhelper"
  msgstr "{itemDesignator} - info on {className}"

in ``en.po`` to reformat the title for the English language. Note that
``{classname}`` is only supported in the default title.

In addition to the default template you can translate a title set
using ``data-popup-title`` by matching the template as the msgid.
Using an example above::

  msgid "Nosy List Classhelper - {itemDesignator}"
  msgstr "Nosy List Klassenhelfer - {itemDesignator}"

placed in ``de.po`` will translate the title into German.

Troubleshooting
---------------

The roundup-classhelper will fallback to using the classic
classhelper if:

  * the user doesn't have REST access
  * the browser doesn't support web components

It will display an alert modal dialog to the user before triggering
the classic classhelper as a fallback. A detailed error will be
printed to the browser console. The console is visible in devtools and
can be opened by pressing the ``F12`` key.

You can disable the classhelper on a per URL basis by adding
``#classhelper-wc-toggle`` to the end of the URL. This will prevent
the web component from starting up.

Also you can set ``DISABLE_CLASSHELP = true`` at the top of
classhelper.js to disable the classhelper without having to make any
changes to your templates.

Advanced Configuration
----------------------

The classhelper.js file has a few tweakable options for use
by advanced users. The endpoint for the roles list requires
the user to have Admin rights. You can add your own roles
endpoint with a different authorization mechanism.  The
following code can be added to your tracker's interfaces.py.
You can create this file if it doesn't exist. This code
creates a new REST endpoint at ``/rest/roles``::

  from roundup.rest import Routing, RestfulInstance, _data_decorator

  class RestfulInstance:

	  @Routing.route("/roles", 'GET')
	  @_data_decorator
	  def get_roles(self, input):
	      """Return all defined roles. The User class property
		 roles is a string but simulate it as a MultiLink
		 to an actual Roles class.
	      """
	      return 200, {"collection":
		  [{"id": rolename,"name": rolename}
		      for rolename in list(self.db.security.role.keys())]}


See the `REST documentation <rest.html>`_ for details on
using ``interfaces.py`` to add new REST endpoints.

The code above allows any user with REST access to see all
the roles defined in the tracker.

To make classhelper.js use this new endpoint, look for::


  const ALTERNATIVE_DROPDOWN_PATHNAMES = {
    "roles": "/rest/data/user/roles"
  }

and change it to::

  const ALTERNATIVE_DROPDOWN_PATHNAMES = {
    "roles": "/rest/roles"
  }

Users may have to perform a hard reload to cache this change
on their system.

Configuring native-fts Full Text Search
=======================================

Roundup release 2.2.0 supports database-native full text search.
SQLite (minimum version 3.9.0) with FTS5 and PostgreSQL (minimum
version 11.0) with websearch_to_tsvector are supported.

To enable this method, change the ``indexer`` setting in the tracker's
config.ini to ``native-fts``. Then reindex using ``roundup-admin -i
tracker_home reindex``.  The amount of time it takes to reindex
depends on the amount of data in your tracker, the speed of your
disks, etc. It can take hours.

SQLite details
--------------

The SQLite native-fts changes the full text search query a little bit.
For the other search methods, the search terms are split on white
space and each item in the index: a field (e.g. title), message
content and file content is searched for all the terms. If any term is
missing that item is ignored. Once the items are found they are mapped
to an issue and the normal issue index is displayed.

When using FTS5, the search terms can use the full text search query
language described at:
https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html#full_text_query_syntax. This
supports:

* plain word search (joined by 'and', similar to other search methods)
* phrase search with terms enclosed in quotes (``"``)
* proximity search with varying distances using ``NEAR()``
* boolean operations by grouping with parentheses and using ``AND``
  and ``OR``
* exclusion using ``NOT``
* prefix searching by prefixing the term with``^``

All of the data that is indexed is in a single column, so when column
specifiers are used they usually result in an error which is detected
and an enhanced error message is produced.

Unlike the native, xapian and whoosh indexers there is no
limit to the length of terms that are indexed. Also
stopwords are indexed but ignored when searching if they are
the only word in the search. So a search for "the" will
return no results but "the book" will return
results. Pre-filtering the stopwords when indexing would
break proximity and phrase searching. This may be helpful or
problematic for your particular tracker.

To support the most languages available, the unicode61 tokenizer is
used without porter stemming. Using the ``indexer_language`` setting
to enable stemming for ``english`` is not available in this
implementation.  Also ranking information is not used in this
implementation. These are areas for improvement.

PostgreSQL info
---------------

The PostgreSQL native-fts changes the full text search query a little
bit. When using PostgreSQL full text search, two different query
languages are supported.

1. websearch - described at the end of
   `Parsing Queries`_ under websearch_to_tsquery. This is the default.

2. tsquery - described at the beginning of `Parsing Queries`_ with
   to_tsquery. It is enabled by starting the search phrase with ``ts:``.

.. _Parsing Queries: \
   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-PARSING-QUERIES

Websearch provides a more natural style of search and supports:

* plain word search (stemmed in most cases)
* phrase search with terms enclosed in quotes (``"``)
* exclusion by prefixing a term/phrase with ``-``
* alternative/or searching with ``or`` between terms
* ignores non-word characters including punctuation

Tsquery supports:

* a strict query syntax
* plain word search
* phrase search with the ``<->`` operator or enclosing the phrase in
  ``'`` single quotes (note this will use a stemmer on the terms
  in the phrase).
* proximity search with varying distances using ``<N>``
* boolean operations by grouping with parentheses and using ``&``
  and ``|``
* exclusion using ``!``
* prefix searching using ``:*`` at the end of the prefix

All of the data that is indexed is in a single column and input
weighing is not used.

Depending on the FTS configuration (determined by the
``indexer_language`` setting), stopwords are supported.  PostgreSQL
takes the stopwords into account when calculating the data needed for
proximity/near searches. Like SQLite FTS, there is no limit to the
length of terms that are indexed. Again this may be helpful or
problematic for your particular tracker.

The config.ini ``indexer_language`` setting is used to define the
configuration used for indexing. For example with the default
``english`` setting a snowball stemmer (english_stem) is used. So
words like 'drive' and 'driving' and 'drive-in' will all match a
search for 'drive' but will not match 'driver'.

The indexer_language is used as the configuration name for every call
to the text search functions (to_tsvector, to_tsquery). Changing this
requires reindexing.

The `configuration list can be obtained using using psql's`_
``\dF`` command.

.. _configuration list can be obtained using using psql's: \
    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-psql.html

Roundup includes a hardcoded list for all languages supported by
PostgreSQL 14.1. The list includes 5 custom "languages"
``custom1`` ... ``custom5`` to allow you to set up your `own textsearch
configuration`_ using one of the custom names. Depending on your
PostgreSQL version, we may allow an invalid language to be configured.
You will see an error about ``text search configuration ... does not
exist``.

.. _own textsearch configuration: \
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-configuration.html

It may be possible to append to this list using the tracker's
interfaces.py. For details, see ``test/test_indexer.py`` in the
roundup distribution and search for ``valid_langs``. If you succeed
please email roundup-users AT lists.sourceforge.net with a description
of your success.

After changing the configuration language, you must reindex the
tracker since the index must match the configuration language used for
querying.

Also there are various `dictionaries`_ that allow you to:

* add stopwords
* override stemming for a term
* add synonyms (e.g. a search for "pg" can also match 'psql'
  "postgresql")
* add terms that expand/contract the search space (Thesaurus
  dictionary)
* additional transforms
  
.. _dictionaries: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/textsearch-dictionaries.html

Use of these is beyond this documentation. Please visit the
appropriate PostgreSQL documents. The following my also be helpful:

* https://rachbelaid.com/postgres-full-text-search-is-good-enough/

Ranking information is not used in this implementation. Also stop
words set in config.ini are ignored. These are areas for improvement.

Cleaning up old native indexes
------------------------------

If you are happy with the database fts indexing, you can save some space by
removing the data from the native text indexing tables. This requires
using the ``sqlite3`` or ``psql`` commands to execute SQL to delete the
rows in the ``__textids`` and ``__words`` tables. You can do this with
the following SQL commands::

   delete from __words;
   delete from __textids;

Note this deletes data from the tables and does *not* delete
the table. This allows you to revert to Roundup's native
full text indexing on SQLite or Postgres. If you were to
delete the tables, Roundup will not recreate the
tables. Under PostgreSQL, you can use the ``truncate
<tablename>`` command if you wish.

Configuring Session Databases
=============================

The session and OTK (one time key) databases
store information about the operation of Roundup.
This ephemeral data:

* web login session keys,
* CSRF tokens,
* email password recovery one time keys,
* rate limiting data,
* ...

can be a performance bottleneck. It usually happens with
anydbm or SQLite backends. PostgreSQL and MySQL are
sufficiently powerful that they can handle the higher
transaction rates.

If you are using sqlite, you can choose to use the anydbm
database for session data. By default it will use additional
sqlite databases for storing the session and otk data.

The following table shows which primary databases support
different session database backends:

.. table:: D - default if unconfigured, + - compatible choice
  :class: captionbelow

  +---------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+------------+
  |               |                session db                    |
  +---------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+------------+
  |primary db     | anydbm | sqlite | redis | mysql | postgresql |
  +===============+========+========+=======+=======+============+
  |anydbm         |    D   |        |   +   |       |            |
  +---------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+------------+
  |sqlite         |    +   |    D   |   +   |       |            |
  +---------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+------------+
  |mysql          |        |        |       |   D   |            |
  +---------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+------------+
  |postgresql     |        |        |       |       |      D     |
  +---------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+------------+

The ``backend`` setting is in the tracker's ``config.ini``
file under the ``sessiondb`` section.

Using Redis for Session Databases
---------------------------------

Redis is an in memory key/value data structure store.

You need to install the redis-py_ module from pypi. Then
install Redis using your package manager or by downloading
it from the Redis_ website.

You need to secure your redis instance. The data that
Roundup stores includes session cookies and other
authentication tokens. At minimum you should require a
password to connect to your redis database. Set
``requirepass`` in ``redis.conf``. Then change the
``redis_url`` in ``config.ini`` to use the password.


For example::

   redis://:mypassword@localhost:7200/10

will connect to the redis instance running on localhost at
port 7200 using the password ``mypassword`` to open database
10. The ``redis_url`` setting can load a file to better
secure the url. If you are using redis 6.0 or newer, you can
specify a username/password and access control lists to
improve the security of your data. Another good alternative
is to talk to redis using a Unix domain socket.

If you are connecting to redis across the network rather
than on localhost, you should configure ssl/tls and use the
``rediss`` scheme in the url along with the query
parameters::

	ssl_cert_reqs=required&ssl_ca_certs=/path/to/custom/ca-cert

where you specify the file that can be used to validate the
SSL certificate. `Securing Redis`_ has more details.

.. _Redis: https://redis.io
.. _redis-py: https://pypi.org/project/redis/
.. _Securing Redis: https://redis.io/docs/manual/security/


Users and Security
==================

Roundup holds its own user database which primarily contains a username,
password and email address for the user. Roundup *must* have its own user
listing, in order to maintain internal consistency of its data. It is a
relatively simple exercise to update this listing on a regular basis, or on
demand, so that it matches an external listing (eg. 
:ref:`unix passwd file<external-authentication>`,
`LDAP <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/LDAPLogin>`_, etc.)

Roundup identifies users in a number of ways:

1. Through the web, users may be identified by either HTTP Basic
   Authentication or cookie authentication. If you are running the web
   server (roundup-server) through another HTTP server (eg. apache or IIS)
   then that server may require HTTP Basic Authentication, and it will pass
   the ``REMOTE_USER`` variable (or variable defined using
   http_auth_header) through to Roundup. If this variable is not
   present, then Roundup defaults to using its own cookie-based login
   mechanism.
2. In email messages handled by roundup-mailgw, users are identified by the
   From address in the message.

In both cases, Roundup's behaviour when dealing with unknown users is
controlled by Permissions defined in the "SECURITY SETTINGS" section of the
tracker's ``schema.py`` module:

Web Access and Register
  If granted to the Anonymous Role, then anonymous users will be able to
  register through the web.
Email Access and Register
  If granted to the Anonymous Role, then email messages from unknown users
  will result in those users being registered with the tracker.

More information about how to customise your tracker's security settings
may be found in the `reference documentation`_.

Configuring Authentication Header/Variable
------------------------------------------

The front end server running Roundup can perform the user
authentication. It pass the authenticated username to the backend in a
variable. By default roundup looks for the ``REMOTE_USER`` variable
This can be changed by setting the parameter ``http_auth_header`` in the
``[web]`` section of the tracker's ``config.ini`` file. If the value
is unset (the default) the REMOTE_USER variable is used.

If you are running roundup using ``roundup-server`` behind a proxy
that authenticates the user you need to configure ``roundup-server`` to
pass the proper header to the tracker. By default ``roundup-server``
looks for the ``REMOTE_USER`` header for the authenticated user.  You
can copy an arbitrary header variable to the tracker using the ``-I``
option to roundup-server (or the equivalent option in the
roundup-server config file).

For example to use the ``uid_variable`` header, two configuration
changes are needed: First configure ``roundup-server`` to pass the
header to the tracker using::

  roundup-server -I uid_variable ....

note that the header is passed exactly as supplied by the upstream
server. It is **not** prefixed with ``HTTP_`` like other headers since
you are explicitly allowing the header. Multiple comma separated
headers can be passed to the ``-I`` option. These could be used in a
detector or other tracker extensions, but only one header can be used
by the tracker as an authentication header.

To make the tracker honor the new variable, change the tracker's
``config.ini`` to read::

  [web]
  ...
  http_auth_header = uid_variable

At the time this is written, support is experimental. If you use it
you should notify the roundup maintainers using the roundup-users
mailing list.


Securing Secrets
================

Roundup can read secrets from a file that is referenced from any
of the config.ini files. If you use Docker, you can bind mount
the files from a secure location, or store them in a subdirectory
of the tracker home.

You can also use a secrets management tool like Docker Swarm's
secrets management. This example config.ini configuration gets
the database password from a file populated by Swarm secrets::

   [rdbms]
   # Database user password.
   # A string that starts with 'file://' is interpreted as a file
   # path relative to the tracker home. Using 'file:///' defines
   # an absolute path. The first line of the file will be used as
   # the value. Any string that does not start with 'file://' is
   # used as is. It removes any whitespace at the end of the
   # line, so a newline can be put in the file.
   # 
   # Default: roundup
   password = file:///run/secrets/db_password

assuming that Docker Swarm secrets has the key ``db_password``
and the ``--secret db_password`` option is used when starting the
Roundup service.

Because environment variables can be inadvertently exposed in
logs or process listings, Roundup does not currently support
loading secrets from environment variables.

Tasks
=====

Maintenance of Roundup can involve one of the following:

1. `tracker backup`_
2. `software upgrade`_
3. `migrating backends`_
4. `moving a tracker`_
5. `migrating from other software`_
6. `adding a user from the command-line`_


Tracker Backup
--------------

The roundup-admin import and export commands are **not** recommended for
performing backup.

Optionally stop the web and email frontends and to copy the contents of the
tracker home directory to some other place using standard backup tools.
This means using
*pg_dump* to take a snapshot of your Postgres backend database, for example.
A simple copy of the tracker home (and files storage area if you've configured
it to be elsewhere) will then complete the backup.


Software Upgrade
----------------

.. _make a backup: #tracker-backup

Always `make a backup`_ of your tracker before upgrading software.
Steps you may take:

1. Install pytest and ensure that the unit tests run on your system
   (using your preferred python version)::

    pip2 install pytest
    python2 -m pytest test/


    pip3 install pytest
    python3 -m pytest test/

2. If you're using an RDBMS backend, make a backup of its contents now.
3. Make a backup of the tracker home itself.
4. Stop the tracker web and email frontends.
5. Install the new version of the software::

    python setup.py install

6. Follow the steps in the `upgrading documentation`_ for all the
   versions between your original version and the new version.

   Usually you should run `roundup_admin -i <tracker_home> migrate`
   on your tracker(s) before you allow users to start accessing the tracker.

   It's safe to run this even if it's not required, so just get into the
   habit.
7. Restart your tracker web and email frontends.

If something bad happens, you may reinstate your backup of the tracker and
reinstall the older version of the sofware using the same install command::

    python setup.py install

.. index:: database; convert from one database backend to another
   single: roundup-admin; import and export

Migrating Backends
------------------

1. Stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes).
2. Use the roundup-admin tool "export" command to export the contents of
   your tracker to disk. (If you are running on windows see
   `issue1441336 <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue1441336>`_
   on how to use the command line rather than interactive mode to
   export data.)
3. Copy the tracker home to a new directory.
4. Delete the "db" directory from the new directory.
5. Set the value of the ``backend`` key under the ``[database]``
   section of the tracker's ``config.ini`` file.
6. Use the roundup-admin "import" command to import the previous export with
   the new tracker home. If non-interactively::
     
     roundup-admin -i <tracker home> import <tracker export dir>

   If interactively, enter 'commit' before exiting.
7. Test each of the admin tool, web interface and mail gateway using the new
   backend.
8. Move the old tracker home out of the way (rename to "tracker.old") and
   move the new tracker home into its place.
9. Restart web and email frontends.

If you are importing into PostgreSQL, it autocommits the data every
10000 objects/rows by default. This can slow down importing, but it
prevents an out of memory error caused by using a savepoint for each
object. You can control the commit frequency by using::

  pragma savepoint_limit=20000

to set a higher or lower number in roundup-admin. In this example a
commit will be done every 20,000 objects/rows. The pragma can also be
set on the roundup-admin command line as described below.

Moving a Tracker
----------------

If you're moving the tracker to a similar machine, you should:

1. install Roundup on the new machine and test that it works there,
2. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes),
3. copy the tracker home directory over to the new machine, and
4. start the tracker web and email frontends on the new machine.

Most of the backends are actually portable across platforms (ie. from Unix to
Windows to Mac). If this isn't the case (ie. the tracker doesn't work when
moved using the above steps) then you'll need to:

1. install Roundup on the new machine and test that it works there,
2. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes),
3. use the roundup-admin tool "export" command to export the contents of
   the existing tracker,
4. copy the export to the new machine,
5. use the roundup-admin "import" command to import the tracker on the new
   machine, and
6. start the tracker web and email frontends on the new machine.

.. index::
   pair: roundup; migrate from other bugtracker software

Migrating From Other Software
-----------------------------

You have a couple of choices. You can either use a CSV import into Roundup,
or you can write a simple Python script which uses the Roundup API
directly. The latter is almost always simpler -- see the "scripts"
directory in the Roundup source for some example uses of the API.

"roundup-admin import" will import data into your tracker from a
directory containing files with the following format:

- one colon-separated-values file per Class with columns for each property,
  named <classname>.csv
- one colon-separated-values file per Class with journal information,
  named <classname>-journals.csv (this is required, even if it's empty)
- if the Class is a FileClass, you may have the "content" property
  stored in separate files from the csv files. This goes in a directory
  structure::

      <classname>-files/<N>/<designator>

  where ``<designator>`` is the item's ``<classname><id>`` combination.
  The ``<N>`` value is ``int(<id> / 1000)``.


.. index:: pair: roundup-admin; managing users

Adding A User From The Command-Line
-----------------------------------

The ``roundup-admin`` program can create any data you wish to in the
database. To create a new user, use::

    roundup-admin create user

To figure out what good values might be for some of the fields (eg. Roles)
you can just display another user::

    roundup-admin list user

(or if you know their username, and it happens to be "richard")::

    roundup-admin filter user username=richard

then using the user id (e.g. 5) you get from one of the above
commands, you may display the user's details::

    roundup-admin display <designator>

where designator is ``user5``.

Running the Servers
===================

Unix
----

On Unix systems, use the scripts/server-ctl script to control the
roundup-server server. Copy it somewhere and edit the variables at the top
to reflect your specific installation.

If you use systemd look at scripts/systemd.gunicorn. It is configured
for a wsgi deployment using gunicorn, but may be a good starting
point for your setup.

Windows
-------

On Windows, the roundup-server program runs as a Windows Service, and
therefore may be controlled through the Services control panel. Note
that you **must** install the pywin32 package to allow roundup to
run as a service. The roundup-server program may also control the
service directly:

**install the service**
  ``roundup-server -C /path/to/my/roundup-server.ini -c install``
**start the service**
  ``roundup-server -c start``
**stop the service**
  ``roundup-server -c stop``

To bring up the services panel:

Windows 2000 and later
  Start/Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Services
Windows NT4
  Start/Control Panel/Services

You will need a server configuration file (as described in
`Configuring roundup-server`_) for specifying tracker homes
and other roundup-server configuration. Specify the name of
this file using the ``-C`` switch when installing the service.

Running the Mail Gateway Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mail gateway script should be scheduled to run regularly on your
Windows server. Normally this will result in a window popping up. The
solution to this is to:

1. Create a new local account on the Roundup server
2. Set the scheduled task to run in the context of this user instead
   of your normal login

Mail gateway script command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage::

    usage: roundup_mailgw.py [-h] [-v] [-c DEFAULT_CLASS] [-I OAUTH_CLIENT_ID]
			     [-O OAUTH_DIRECTORY] [-S SET_VALUE]
			     [-T OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT]
			     [args ...]


The roundup mail gateway may be called in one of three ways:

- without arguments. Then the env var ROUNDUP_INSTANCE will be tried.
- with an instance home as the only argument,
- with both an instance home and a mail spool file, or
- with an instance home, a mail source type and its specification.

It also supports optional ``-S`` (or ``--set-value``) arguments that allows you
to set fields for a class created by the roundup-mailgw. The format for
this option is [class.]property=value where class can be omitted and
defaults to msg. The ``-S`` options uses the same
property=value[;property=value] notation accepted by the command line
roundup command or the commands that can be given on the Subject line of
an email message (if you're using multiple properties delimited with a
semicolon the class must be specified only once in the beginning).

It can let you set the type of the message on a per e-mail address basis
by calling roundup-mailgw with different email addresses and other
settings.

PIPE:
 If there is no mail source specified, the mail gateway reads a single
 message from the standard input and submits the message to the
 roundup.mailgw module.

UNIX mailbox:
 In this case, the gateway reads all messages from the UNIX mail spool
 file and submits each in turn to the roundup.mailgw module. The file is
 emptied once all messages have been successfully handled. The file is
 specified as::

   mailbox /path/to/mailbox

In all of the following mail source types, the username and password
can be stored in a ``~/.netrc`` file. If done so, only the server name
needs to be specified on the command-line.
The username and/or password will be prompted for if not supplied on
the command-line or in ``~/.netrc``.

POP:
 For the mail source "pop", the gateway reads all messages from the POP
 server specified and submits each in turn to the roundup.mailgw module.
 The server is specified as::

    pop username:password@server

 The username and password may be omitted::

    pop username@server
    pop server

 are both valid.

POPS:
 Connect to a POP server over tls/ssl.
 This supports the same notation as POP::

    pops username:password@server

APOP:
 Same as POP, but using Authenticated POP::

    apop username:password@server

IMAP:
 Connect to an IMAP server. This supports the same notation as that of
 POP mail::

    imap username:password@server

 It also allows you to specify a specific mailbox other than INBOX using
 this format::

    imap username:password@server mailbox

IMAPS:
 Connect to an IMAP server over tls/ssl.
 This supports the same notation as IMAP::

    imaps username:password@server [mailbox]

IMAPS_CRAM:
 Connect to an IMAP server over tls/ssl using CRAM-MD5 authentication.
 This supports the same notation as IMAP::

    imaps_cram username:password@server [mailbox]

IMAPS_OAUTH:
 Connect to an IMAP server over tls/ssl using OAUTH authentication.
 Note that this does not support a password in imaps URLs.
 Instead it uses only the user and server and a command-line option for
 the directory with the files ``access_token``, ``refresh_token``,
 ``client_secret``, and ``client_id``.
 By default this directory is ``oauth`` in your tracker home directory. The
 access token is tried first and, if expired, the refresh token together
 with the client secret is used to retrieve a new access token. Note that
 both token files need to be *writeable*, the access token is
 continuously replaced and some cloud providers may also renew the
 refresh token from time to time::

   imaps_oauth username@server [mailbox]

 The refresh and access tokens (the latter can be left empty), the
 client id and the client secret need to be retrieved via cloud provider
 specific protocols or websites.

 You need the requests_ library installed to ue the IMAPS_OAUTH method.

Using roundup-admin
===================

Part of the installation includes a man page for roundup-admin.  Ypu
should be able to read it using ``man roundup-admin``. As shown above,
it is a generic tool for manipulating the underlying database for you
tracker.

Examples above show how to use it to:

* install and initialize a new tracker
* export/import tracker data for migrating between backends
* creating a new user from the command line
* list/find users in the tracker

The basic usage is:

.. code-block:: text

 Usage: roundup-admin [options] [<command> <arguments>]

 Options:
  -i instance home  -- specify the issue tracker "home directory" to administer
  -u                -- the user[:password] to use for commands (default admin)
  -d                -- print full designators not just class id numbers
  -c                -- when outputting lists of data, comma-separate them.
                       Same as '-S ","'.
  -S <string>       -- when outputting lists of data, string-separate them
  -s                -- when outputting lists of data, space-separate them.
                       Same as '-S " "'.
  -P pragma=value   -- Set a pragma on command line rather than interactively.
                       Can be used multiple times.
  -V                -- be verbose when importing
  -v                -- report Roundup and Python versions (and quit)

  Only one of -s, -c or -S can be specified.

 Help:
  roundup-admin -h
  roundup-admin help                       -- this help
  roundup-admin help <command>             -- command-specific help
  roundup-admin help all                   -- all available help

 Commands:
  commit
  create classname property=value ...
  display designator[,designator]*
  export [[-]class[,class]] export_dir
  exporttables [[-]class[,class]] export_dir
  filter classname propname=value ...
  find classname propname=value ...
  genconfig <filename>
  get property designator[,designator]*
  help topic
  history designator [skipquiet] [raw]
  import import_dir
  importtables export_dir
  initialise [adminpw]
  install [template [backend [key=val[,key=val]]]]
  list classname [property]
  migrate
  pack period | date
  perftest [mode] [arguments]*
  pragma setting=value | 'list'
  reindex [classname|classname:#-#|designator]*
  restore designator[,designator]*
  retire designator[,designator]*
  rollback
  security [Role name]
  set items property=value [property=value ...]
  specification classname
  table classname [property[,property]*]
  templates [trace_search]
  updateconfig <filename>
 Commands may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation
 matches only one command, e.g. l == li == lis == list.

One thing to note, The ``-u user`` setting does not currently operate
like a user logging in via the web. The user running roundup-admin
must have read access to the tracker home directory. As a result the
user has access to the files and the database info contained in
config.ini.

Using ``-u user`` sets the actor/user parameter in the
journal. Changes that are made are attributed to that
user. The password is ignored if provided. Any existing
username has full access to the data just like the admin
user. This is an area for further development so that
roundup-admin could be used with sudo to provide secure
command line access to a tracker.

In general you should forget that there is a -u parameter.

All commands (except help, genconfig, templates) require a tracker
specifier. This is just the path to the roundup tracker you're working
with. A roundup tracker is where roundup keeps the database and
configuration file that defines an issue tracker. It may be thought of
as the issue tracker's "home directory". It may be specified in the
environment variable ``TRACKER_HOME`` or on the command line as "``-i
tracker``".

A designator is a classname and an itemid concatenated, eg. bug1,
user10, ... Property values are represented as strings in command
arguments and in the printed results:

- Strings are, well, strings.
- Password values will display as their encoded value.
- Date values are printed in the full date format in the local time
  zone, and accepted in the full format or any of the partial formats
  explained below.::

    Input of...        Means...
    "2000-04-17.03:45" 2000-04-17.03:45:00
    "2000-04-17"       2000-04-17.00:00:00
    "01-25"            yyyy-01-25.00:00:00
    "08-13.22:13"      yyyy-08-13.22:13:00
    "11-07.09:32:43"   yyyy-11-07.09:32:43
    "14:25"            yyyy-mm-dd.14:25:00
    "8:47:11"          yyyy-mm-dd.08:47:11
    "2003"             2003-01-01.00:00:00
    "2003-04"          2003-04-01.00:00:00
    "."                "right now"

- Link values are printed as item designators. When given as an
  argument, item designators and key strings are both accepted.
- Multilink values are printed as lists of item designators joined by
  commas. When given as an argument, item designators and key strings
  are both accepted; an empty string, a single item, or a list of items
  joined by commas is accepted.

When multiple items are specified to the roundup get or roundup set
commands, the specified properties are retrieved or set on all the
listed items.  When multiple results are returned by the roundup get or
roundup find commands, they are printed one per line (default) or joined
by commas (with the "``-c``" option).

Where the command changes data, a login name/password is required. The
login may be specified as either "``name``" or "``name:password``".

- ``ROUNDUP_LOGIN`` environment variable
- the "``-u``" command-line option

If either the name or password is not supplied, they are obtained from
the command-line.

The ``-u user`` setting does not currently operate like a
user logging in via the web. The user running roundup-admin
must have read access to the tracker home directory. As a
result the user has access to the files and the database
info contained in config.ini.

Using ``-u user`` sets the actor/user parameter in the
journal. Changes that are made are attributed to that
user. The password is ignored if provided. Any existing
username has full access to the data just like the admin
user. This is an area for further development so that
roundup-admin could be used with sudo to provide secure
command line access to a tracker.

.. _initpw:

When you initialise a new tracker instance you are prompted for the
admin password. If you want to initialise a tracker non-interactively
you can put the initialise command and password on the command
line. But this allows others on the host to see the password (using
the ps command). To initialise a tracker non-interactively without
exposing the password, create a file (e.g init_tracker) set to mode
600 (so only the owner can read it) with the contents:

   initialise admin_password

and feed it to roundup-admin on standard input. E.G.

  cat init_tracker | roundup-admin -i tracker_dir

(for more details see https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550789.)

.. index:: ! roundup-admin; usage in scripts

Using Interactively
-------------------

You can edit the command line using left/right arrow keys to move the
cursor. Using the up/down arrow keys moves among commands. It will
save your commands between roundup-admin sessions. This is supported
on Unix/Linux and Mac's. On windows you should install the pyreadline3
package (see `installation documentation`_).

Using the ``history_length`` pragma you can set the saved history size
for just one session.

You can add initialization commands to ``~/.roundup_admin_rlrc``. It
will be loaded when roundup-admin starts. This is the mechanism to
persistently set the number of history commands, change editing modes
(Vi vs. Emacs). Note that redefining the history file will not work.

If you are using GNU readline, ``set history-size 10``. If your
installation uses libedit (macs), it should be possible to
persistently set the history size using ``history size
10``. Pyreadline3 can set history length using
``history_length(10)``. See the documentation for example syntax:
https://pythonhosted.org/pyreadline/usage.html#configuration-file.

History is saved to the file ``.roundup_admin_history`` in your home
directory (for windows usually ``\Users\<username>``.

Using with the shell
--------------------

With version 0.6.0 or newer of roundup (which introduced support for
multiple designators to display and the -d, -S and -s flags):

To find all messages regarding chatting issues that contain the word
"spam", for example, you could execute the following command from the
directory where the database dumps its files::

    shell% for issue in `roundup-admin -ds find issue status=chatting`; do
    > grep -l spam `roundup-admin -ds ' ' get messages $issue`
    > done
    msg23
    msg49
    msg50
    msg61
    shell%

Or, using the -dc option, this can be written as a single command::

    shell% grep -l spam `roundup get messages \
        \`roundup -dc find issue status=chatting\``
    msg23
    msg49
    msg50
    msg61
    shell%

You can also display issue contents::

    shell% roundup-admin display `roundup-admin -dc get messages \
               issue3,issue1`
    files: []
    inreplyto: None
    recipients: []
    author: 1
    date: 2003-02-16.21:23:03
    messageid: None
    summary: jkdskldjf
    files: []
    inreplyto: None
    recipients: []
    author: 1
    date: 2003-02-15.01:59:11
    messageid: None
    summary: jlkfjadsf

or status::

    shell% roundup-admin get name `/tools/roundup/bin/roundup-admin \
          -dc -i /var/roundup/sysadmin get status issue3,issue1`
    unread
    deferred

or status on a single line::

    shell% echo `roundup-admin get name \`/tools/roundup/bin/roundup-admin \
             -dc -i /var/roundup/sysadmin get status issue3,issue1\``
    unread deferred

which is the same as::

    shell% roundup-admin -s get name `/tools/roundup/bin/roundup-admin \
             -dc -i /var/roundup/sysadmin get status issue3,issue1`
    unread deferred

Also the tautological::

   shell% roundup-admin get name \
      `roundup-admin -dc get status \`roundup-admin -dc find issue \
          status=chatting\``
   chatting
   chatting

Remember the roundup commands that accept multiple designators accept
them ',' separated so using '-dc' is almost always required.

A Note on Import and Export
---------------------------

This is a little in the weeds, but I have noticed this and was asked
about it so I am documenting it for the future.

Running ``roundup-admin`` with ``-V`` to get additional info when
importing/exporting the tracker generates three types of messages.

For example::

   $ roundup-admin -i tracker -V export ./myExport
   Exporting priority - 5
   Exporting Journal for priority
   Exporting status - 1
   Exporting Journal for status
   [...]


   $ roundup-admin -i tracker -V import ./myExport
   Importing priority - 7
   setting priority 8
   Importing status - 8
   setting status 9
   [...]

Note the numbers for status. Exported ends up at 1, Imported ends up
at 8 and setting chooses 9. These numbers are derived differently and
used differently. You can't directly compare them.

``Exporting issue - XXX``:

   ``XXX`` is the id number of the node being exported/processed from
   the database. The order is determined by sorting by the key of the
   class (as set by sortkey). If the class key is 'id', then it's a
   string sort so '9' comes before '1009'. You might notice if the
   export is slow the numbers jumping around.

   It does not usually end up as the total number of nodes
   exported. However if it crashes, you know what node it was
   processing at the time.

   In the example above, the status node with id 1 was the last one
   when sorted alphabetically by name.

``Importing <class> - XXX``:

    ``XXX`` is the number of the node (not the node id) being
    imported/currently processed at line XXX+1 in the file. It is an
    incrementing number starting at 0 and never jumps around. Value 0
    is consumed when reading the header and not displayed. The final
    value is the same as the number of objects and one less then the
    number of lines in the file. If it crashes, you were processing
    the line at XXX+1.

``setting <class> XXX``:

    ``XXX`` in the setting line should always be one more than the
    number of imported objects. The setting value is the id for the
    next created object of that type. So in theory the Importing
    number should be one less than the setting number.

    However under certain circumstances, Roundup can skip an id
    number. This can lead to a difference of more than 1 between the
    Importing and setting numbers. It's not a problem. However setting
    can (and must) always be higher than the Importing number.
