What does Roundup install?
==========================

There's two "installations" that we talk about when using Roundup:

1. The installation of the software and its support files. This uses the
   standard Python mechanism called "distutils" and thus Roundup's core code,
   executable scripts and support data files are installed in Python's
   directories. On Windows, this is typically:

   Scripts
     ``<python dir>\scripts\...``
   Core code
     ``<python dir>\lib\site-packages\roundup\...``
   Support files
     ``<python dir>\share\roundup\...``

   and on Unix-like systems (eg. Linux):

   Scripts
     ``<python root>/bin/...``
   Core code
     ``<python root>/lib-<python version>/site-packages/roundup/...``
   Support files
     ``<python root>/share/roundup/...``

2. The installation of a specific tracker. When invoking the roundup-admin
   "inst" (and "init") commands, you're creating a new Roundup tracker. This
   installs configuration files, HTML templates, detector code and a new
   database. You have complete control over where this stuff goes through
   both choosing your "tracker home" and the ``main`` -> ``database`` variable
   in the tracker's config.ini.


Configuring Roundup's Logging of Messages For Sysadmins
=======================================================

You may configure where Roundup logs messages in your tracker's config.ini
file. Roundup will use the standard Python (2.3+) logging implementation.

Configuration for standard "logging" module:
 - tracker configuration file specifies the location of a logging
   configration file as ``logging`` -> ``config``
 - ``roundup-server`` specifies the location of a logging configuration
   file on the command line
Configuration for "BasicLogging" implementation:
 - tracker configuration file specifies the location of a log file
   ``logging`` -> ``filename``
 - tracker configuration file specifies the level to log to as
   ``logging`` -> ``level``
 - ``roundup-server`` specifies the location of a log file on the command
   line
 - ``roundup-server`` specifies the level to log to on the command line

(``roundup-mailgw`` always logs to the tracker's log file)

In both cases, if no logfile is specified then logging will simply be sent
to sys.stderr with only logging of ERROR messages.


Configuring roundup-server
==========================

The basic configuration file is as follows (taken from the
``roundup-server.ini.example`` file in the "doc" directory)::

  [main]

  # Host name of the Roundup web server instance.
  # If left unconfigured (no 'host' setting) the default
  # will be used.
  # If empty, listen on all network interfaces.
  # If you want to explicitly listen on all
  # network interfaces, the address 0.0.0.0 is a more
  # explicit way to achieve this, the use of an empty
  # string for this purpose is deprecated and will go away
  # in a future release.
  # Default: localhost
  host = localhost

  # Port to listen on.
  # Default: 8080
  port = 8017

  # Path to favicon.ico image file.  If unset, built-in favicon.ico is used.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: favicon.ico
  favicon = favicon.ico

  # User ID as which the server will answer requests.
  # In order to use this option, the server must be run initially as root.
  # Availability: Unix.
  # Default: 
  user = roundup

  # Group ID as which the server will answer requests.
  # In order to use this option, the server must be run initially as root.
  # Availability: Unix.
  # Default: 
  group = 

  # don't fork (this overrides the pidfile mechanism)'
  # Allowed values: yes, no
  # Default: no
  nodaemon = no

  # Log client machine names instead of IP addresses (much slower)
  # Allowed values: yes, no
  # Default: no
  log_hostnames = no

  # File to which the server records the process id of the daemon.
  # If this option is not set, the server will run in foreground
  # 
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: 
  pidfile = 

  # Log file path.  If unset, log to stderr.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: 
  logfile = 

  # Set processing of each request in separate subprocess.
  # Allowed values: debug, none, thread, fork.
  # Default: fork
  multiprocess = fork

  # Tracker index template. If unset, built-in will be used.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: 
  template = 

  # Enable SSL support (requires pyopenssl)
  # Allowed values: yes, no
  # Default: no
  ssl = no

  # PEM file used for SSL. A temporary self-signed certificate
  # will be used if left blank.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  # Default: 
  pem = 

  # Roundup trackers to serve.
  # Each option in this section defines single Roundup tracker.
  # Option name identifies the tracker and will appear in the URL.
  # Option value is tracker home directory path.
  # The path may be either absolute or relative
  # to the directory containing this config file.
  [trackers]

  demo = /trackers/demo
  sysadmin = /trackers/sysadmin

Additional notes for each keyword:

**template**
  Specifies a template used for displaying the tracker index when
  multiple trackers are being used. It is processed by TAL and
  the variable "trackers" is available to the template and is a
  dict of all configured trackers.
**ssl**
  Enables the use of SSL to secure the connection to the roundup-server.
  If you enable this, ensure that your tracker's config.ini specifies
  an *https* URL.
**pem**
  If specified, the SSL PEM file containing the private key and certificate.
  If not specified, roundup will generate a temporary, self-signed certificate
  for use.
**trackers** section
  Each line denotes a mapping from a URL component to a tracker home.
  Make sure the name part doesn't include any url-unsafe characters like
  spaces. Stick to alphanumeric characters and you'll be ok.

To generate a config.ini in the current directory (note it will
overwrite an existing file) from the roundup-server command line use::

 roundup_server -p 8017  -u roundup --save-config  demo=/trackers/demo \
    sysadmin=/trackers/sysadmin

Configuring Compression
=======================

Roundup will compress HTTP responses to clients on the fly. Dynamic,
on the fly, compression is enabled by default, to disable it set::

    [web]
    ...
    dynamic_compression = No

in the tracker's ``config.ini``. You should disable compression if
your proxy (e.g. nginx or apache) or wsgi server (uwsgi) is configured
to compress responses on the fly. The python standard library includes
gzip support. For brotli or zstd you will need to install packges. See
the `installation documentation`_ for details.

Some assets will not be compressed on the fly. Assets with mime types
of "image/png" or "image/jpeg" will not be compressed. You
can add mime types to the list by using ``interfaces.py`` as discussed
in the `customisation documentation`_. As an example adding::

  from roundup.cgi.client import Client

  Client.precompressed_mime_types.append('application/zip`)

to ``interfaces.py`` will prevent zip files from being compressed.

Any content less than 100 bytes in size will not be compressed (e.g
errors messages, short json responses).

Zstd will be used if the client can understand it, followed by brotli
then gzip encoding. Currently the preference order is hard coded into
the server and not parsed using ``q`` values from the client's
Accept-Encoding header. This is an area for improvement.

In addition to dynamic compression, static files/assets accessed using
``@@file`` can be pre-compressed. This reduces CPU load on the server
and reduces the time required to respond to the client. By default
searching for pre-compressed files is disabled. To enable it set::

    [web]
    ...
    use_precompressed_files = Yes

in the tracker's ``config.ini`` file. Then you can create a
precompressed file and it will be served if the client is able to
accept it. For a file ``.../@@file/library.js`` you can create::

    tracker_home/html/library.js.gzip
    tracker_home/html/library.js.br
    tracker_home/html/library.js.zstd

which should be created by using (respectively)::

      gzip --keep --suffix .gzip library.js
      brotli library.js
      zstd library.js && mv library.js.zst library.js.zstd

see the man pages for options that control compression level. Note
that some levels require additional memory on the client side, so you
may not always want to use the highest compression available.

A pre-compressed file will not be used if its modified date is earlier
than the uncompressed file. For example, if ``library.js.gzip`` is
older (has earlier modification date) than ``library.js``,
``library.js.gzip`` will be ignored. ``library.js`` will be
served instead.  ``library.js`` will be dynamically compressed on the
fly and a warning message will be logged.

Precompressed files override dynamic compression. For example, assume
the client can accept brotli and gzip. If there are no precompressed
files, the data will be compressed dynamically (on the fly) using
brotli. If there is a precompressed gzip file present the client will
get the gzip version and not a brotli compressed version. This
mechanism allows the admin to allow use of brotli and zstd for
dynamic content, but not for static content.

Configuring native-fts Full Text Search
=======================================

Roundup release 2.2.0 supports database-native full text search.
SQLite (minimum version 3.9.0) with FTS5 and PostgreSQL (minimum
version 11.0) with websearch_to_tsvector are supported.

To enable this method, change the ``indexer`` setting in the tracker's
config.ini to ``native-fts``. Then reindex using ``roundup-admin -i
tracker_home reindex``.  The amount of time it takes to reindex
depends on the amount of data in your tracker, the speed of your
disks, etc. It can take hours.

SQLite details
--------------

The SQLite native-fts changes the full text search query a little bit.
For the other search methods, the search terms are split on white
space and each item in the index: a field (e.g. title), message
content and file content is searched for all the terms. If any term is
missing that item is ignored. Once the items are found they are mapped
to an issue and the normal issue index is displayed.

When using FTS5, the search terms can use the full text search query
language described at:
https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html#full_text_query_syntax. This
supports:

  * plain word search (joined with and similar to other search methods)
  * phrase search with terms enclosed in quotes (``"``)
  * proximity search with varying distances using ``NEAR()``
  * boolean operations by grouping with parentheses and using ``AND``
    and ``OR``
  * exclusion using ``NOT``
  * prefix searching by prefixing the term with``^``

All of the data that is indexed is in a single column, so when column
specifiers are used they usually result in an error which is detected
and an enhanced error message is produced.

Unlike the native, xapian and whoosh indexers, there are no stopwords,
and there is no limit to the length of terms that are indexed. Keeping
these would break proximity and phrase searching. This may be helpful
or problematic for your particular tracker.

To support the most languages available, the unicode61 tokenizer is
used without porter stemming. Using the ``indexer_language`` setting
to enable stemming for ``english`` is not available in this
implementation.  Also ranking information is not used in this
implementation. These are areas for improvement.

PostgreSQL info
---------------

The PostgreSQL native-fts changes the full text search query a little
bit. When using PostgreSQL full text search, two different query
languages are supported.

1. websearch - described at the end of
   `Parsing Queries`_ under websearch_to_tsquery. This is the default.

2. tsquery - described at the beginning of `Parsing Queries`_ with
   to_tsquery. It is enabled by starting the search phrase with ``ts:``.

.. _Parsing Queries: \
   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-PARSING-QUERIES

Websearch provides a more natural style of search and supports:

* plain word search (stemmed in most cases)
* phrase search with terms enclosed in quotes (``"``)
* exclusion by prefixing a term/phrase with ``-``
* alternative/or searching with ``or`` between terms
* ignores non-word characters including punctuation

Tsquery supports:

* a strict query syntax
* plain word search
* phrase search with the ``<->`` operator or enclosing the phrase in
  ``'`` single quotes (note this will use a stemmer on the terms
  in the phrase).
* proximity search with varying distances using ``<N>``
* boolean operations by grouping with parentheses and using ``&``
  and ``|``
* exclusion using ``!``
* prefix searching using ``:*`` at the end of the prefix

All of the data that is indexed is in a single column and input
weighing is not used.

Depending on the FTS configuration (determined by the
``indexer_language`` setting), stopwords are supported.  PostgreSQL
takes the stopwords into account when calculating the data needed for
proximity/near searches. Like SQLite FTS, there is no limit to the
length of terms that are indexed. Again this may be helpful or
problematic for your particular tracker.

The config.ini ``indexer_language`` setting is used to define the
configuration used for indexing. For example with the default
``english`` setting a snowball stemmer (english_stem) is used. So
words like 'drive' and 'driving' and 'drive-in' will all match a
search for 'drive' but will not match 'driver'.

The indexer_language is used as the configuration name for every call
to the text search functions (to_tsvector, to_tsquery). Changing this
requires reindexing.

The `configuration list can be obtained using using psql's`_
``\dF`` command.

.. _configuration list can be obtained using using psql's: \
    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-psql.html

Roundup includes a hardcoded list for all languages supported by
PostgreSQL 14.1. The list includes 5 custom "languages"
``custom1`` ... ``custom5`` to allow you to set up your `own textsearch
configuration`_ using one of the custom names. Depending on your
PostgreSQL version, we may allow an invalid language to be configured.
You will see an error about ``text search configuration ... does not
exist``.

.. _own textsearch configuration: \
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/textsearch-configuration.html

It may be possible to append to this list using the tracker's
interfaces.py. For details, see ``test/test_indexer.py`` in the
roundup distribution and search for ``valid_langs``. If you succeed
please email roundup-users AT lists.sourceforge.net with a description
of your success.

After changing the configuration language, you must reindex the
tracker since the index must match the configuration language used for
querying.

Also there are various `dictionaries`_ that allow you to:

  * add stopwords
  * override stemming for a term
  * add synonyms (e.g. a search for "pg" can also match 'psql'
    "postgresql")
  * add terms that expand/contract the search space (Thesaurus
    dictionary)
  * additional transforms
  
.. _dictionaries: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/textsearch-dictionaries.html

Use of these is beyond this documentation. Please visit the
appropriate PostgreSQL documents. The following my also be helpful:

* http://rachbelaid.com/postgres-full-text-search-is-good-enough/

Ranking information is not used in this implementation. Also stop
words set in config.ini are ignored. These are areas for improvement.

Cleaning up old native indexes
------------------------------

If you are happy with the database fts indexing, you can save some space by
removing the data from the native text indexing tables. This requires
using the ``sqlite3`` or ``psql`` commands to execute SQL to delete the
rows in the ``__textids`` and ``__words`` tables. You can do this with
the following SQL commands::

   delete from __words;
   delete from __textids;

Note this deletes data from the tables and does *not* delete the
table.

Users and Security
==================

Roundup holds its own user database which primarily contains a username,
password and email address for the user. Roundup *must* have its own user
listing, in order to maintain internal consistency of its data. It is a
relatively simple exercise to update this listing on a regular basis, or on
demand, so that it matches an external listing (eg. 
:ref:`unix passwd file<external-authentication>`,
`LDAP <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/LDAPLogin>`_, etc.)

Roundup identifies users in a number of ways:

1. Through the web, users may be identified by either HTTP Basic
   Authentication or cookie authentication. If you are running the web
   server (roundup-server) through another HTTP server (eg. apache or IIS)
   then that server may require HTTP Basic Authentication, and it will pass
   the ``REMOTE_USER`` variable (or variable defined using
   http_auth_header) through to Roundup. If this variable is not
   present, then Roundup defaults to using its own cookie-based login
   mechanism.
2. In email messages handled by roundup-mailgw, users are identified by the
   From address in the message.

In both cases, Roundup's behaviour when dealing with unknown users is
controlled by Permissions defined in the "SECURITY SETTINGS" section of the
tracker's ``schema.py`` module:

Web Registration
  If granted to the Anonymous Role, then anonymous users will be able to
  register through the web.
Email Registration
  If granted to the Anonymous Role, then email messages from unknown users
  will result in those users being registered with the tracker.

More information about how to customise your tracker's security settings
may be found in the `customisation documentation`_.

Configuring Authentication Header/Variable
------------------------------------------

The front end server running roundup can perform the user
authentication. It pass the authenticated username to the backend in a
variable. By default roundup looks for the ``REMOTE_USER`` variable
This can be changed by setting the parameter ``http_auth_header`` in the
``[web]`` section of the tracker's ``config.ini`` file. If the value
is unset (the default) the REMOTE_USER variable is used.

If you are running roundup using ``roundup-server`` behind a proxy
that authenticates the user you need to configure ``roundup-server`` to
pass the proper header to the tracker. By default ``roundup-server``
looks for the ``REMOTE_USER`` header for the authenticated user.  You
can copy an arbitrary header variable to the tracker using the ``-I``
option to roundup-server (or the equivalent option in the
roundup-server config file).

For example to use the ``uid_variable`` header, two configuration
changes are needed: First configure ``roundup-server`` to pass the
header to the tracker using::

  roundup-server -I uid_variable ....

note that the header is passed exactly as supplied by the upstream
server. It is **not** prefixed with ``HTTP_`` like other headers since
you are explicitly whitelisting the header. Multiple comma separated
headers can be passed to the ``-I`` option. These could be used in a
detector or other tracker extensions, but only one header can be used
by the tracker as an authentication header.

To make the tracker honor the new variable changing the tracker
``config.ini`` to read::

  [web]
  ...
  http_auth_header = uid_variable

At the time this is written, support is experimental. If you use it
you should notify the roundup maintainers using the roundup-users
mailing list.

Tasks
=====

Maintenance of Roundup can involve one of the following:

1. `tracker backup`_
2. `software upgrade`_
3. `migrating backends`_
4. `moving a tracker`_
5. `migrating from other software`_
6. `adding a user from the command-line`_


Tracker Backup
--------------

The roundup-admin import and export commands are **not** recommended for
performing backup.

Optionally stop the web and email frontends and to copy the contents of the
tracker home directory to some other place using standard backup tools.
This means using
*pg_dump* to take a snapshot of your Postgres backend database, for example.
A simple copy of the tracker home (and files storage area if you've configured
it to be elsewhere) will then complete the backup.


Software Upgrade
----------------

Always make a backup of your tracker before upgrading software. Steps you may
take:

1. Install pytest and ensure that the unit tests run on your system
   (using your preferred python version)::

    pip2 install pytest
    python2 -m pytest test/


    pip3 install pytest
    python3 -m pytest test/

2. If you're using an RDBMS backend, make a backup of its contents now.
3. Make a backup of the tracker home itself.
4. Stop the tracker web and email frontends.
5. Install the new version of the software::

    python setup.py install

6. Follow the steps in the `upgrading documentation`_ for the new version of
   the software in the copied.

   Usually you will be asked to run `roundup_admin migrate` on your tracker
   before you allow users to start accessing the tracker.

   It's safe to run this even if it's not required, so just get into the
   habit.
7. Restart your tracker web and email frontends.

If something bad happens, you may reinstate your backup of the tracker and
reinstall the older version of the sofware using the same install command::

    python setup.py install


.. index:: database; convert from one database backend to another
   single: roundup-admin; import and export

Migrating Backends
------------------

1. Stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes).
2. Use the roundup-admin tool "export" command to export the contents of
   your tracker to disk. (If you are running on windows see
   `issue1441336 <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue1441336>`_
   on how to use the command line rather than interactive mode to
   export data.)
3. Copy the tracker home to a new directory.
4. Delete the "db" directory from the new directory.
5. Set the value of the ``backend`` key under the ``[database]``
   section of the tracker's ``config.ini`` file.
6. Use the roundup-admin "import" command to import the previous export with
   the new tracker home. If non-interactively::
     
     roundup-admin -i <tracker home> import <tracker export dir>

   If interactively, enter 'commit' before exiting.
7. Test each of the admin tool, web interface and mail gateway using the new
   backend.
8. Move the old tracker home out of the way (rename to "tracker.old") and
   move the new tracker home into its place.
9. Restart web and email frontends.


Moving a Tracker
----------------

If you're moving the tracker to a similar machine, you should:

1. install Roundup on the new machine and test that it works there,
2. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes),
3. copy the tracker home directory over to the new machine, and
4. start the tracker web and email frontends on the new machine.

Most of the backends are actually portable across platforms (ie. from Unix to
Windows to Mac). If this isn't the case (ie. the tracker doesn't work when
moved using the above steps) then you'll need to:

1. install Roundup on the new machine and test that it works there,
2. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes),
3. use the roundup-admin tool "export" command to export the contents of
   the existing tracker,
4. copy the export to the new machine,
5. use the roundup-admin "import" command to import the tracker on the new
   machine, and
6. start the tracker web and email frontends on the new machine.

.. index::
   pair: roundup; migrate from other bugtracker software

Migrating From Other Software
-----------------------------

You have a couple of choices. You can either use a CSV import into Roundup,
or you can write a simple Python script which uses the Roundup API
directly. The latter is almost always simpler -- see the "scripts"
directory in the Roundup source for some example uses of the API.

"roundup-admin import" will import data into your tracker from a
directory containing files with the following format:

- one colon-separated-values file per Class with columns for each property,
  named <classname>.csv
- one colon-separated-values file per Class with journal information,
  named <classname>-journals.csv (this is required, even if it's empty)
- if the Class is a FileClass, you may have the "content" property
  stored in separate files from the csv files. This goes in a directory
  structure::

      <classname>-files/<N>/<designator>

  where ``<designator>`` is the item's ``<classname><id>`` combination.
  The ``<N>`` value is ``int(<id> / 1000)``.


.. index:: pair: roundup-admin; managing users

Adding A User From The Command-Line
-----------------------------------

The ``roundup-admin`` program can create any data you wish to in the
database. To create a new user, use::

    roundup-admin create user

To figure out what good values might be for some of the fields (eg. Roles)
you can just display another user::

    roundup-admin list user

(or if you know their username, and it happens to be "richard")::

    roundup-admin filter user username=richard

then using the user id (e.g. 5) you get from one of the above
commands, you may display the user's details::

    roundup-admin display <designator>

where designator is ``user5``.

Running the Servers
===================

Unix
----

On Unix systems, use the scripts/server-ctl script to control the
roundup-server server. Copy it somewhere and edit the variables at the top
to reflect your specific installation.

If you use systemd look at scripts/systemd.gunicorn. It is configured
for a wsgi deployment using gunicorn, but may be a good starting
point for your setup.

Windows
-------

On Windows, the roundup-server program runs as a Windows Service, and
therefore may be controlled through the Services control panel. Note
that you **must** install the pywin32 package to allow roundup to
run as a service. The roundup-server program may also control the
service directly:

**install the service**
  ``roundup-server -C /path/to/my/roundup-server.ini -c install``
**start the service**
  ``roundup-server -c start``
**stop the service**
  ``roundup-server -c stop``

To bring up the services panel:

Windows 2000 and later
  Start/Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Services
Windows NT4
  Start/Control Panel/Services

You will need a server configuration file (as described in
`Configuring roundup-server`_) for specifying tracker homes
and other roundup-server configuration. Specify the name of
this file using the ``-C`` switch when installing the service.

Running the Mail Gateway Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mail gateway script should be scheduled to run regularly on your
Windows server. Normally this will result in a window popping up. The
solution to this is to:

1. Create a new local account on the Roundup server
2. Set the scheduled task to run in the context of this user instead
   of your normal login

.. index:: ! roundup-admin
   single: roundup-admin; man page reference

Using roundup-admin
===================

Part of the installation includes a man page for roundup-admin.  Ypu
should be able to read it using ``man roundup-admin``. As shown above,
it is a generic tool for manipulating the underlying database for you
tracker.

Examples above show how to use it to:

   * install and initialize a new tracker
   * export/import tracker data for migrating between backends
   * creating a new user fom the command line
   * list/find users in the tracker

A brief (incomplete) summary is::

    roundup-admin help
    roundup-admin -i <tracker_dir> get [-list] designator[, designator,...] propname
    roundup-admin -i <tracker_dir> set designator[, designator,...] propname=value ...
    roundup-admin -i <tracker_dir> find [-list] classname propname=value ...

Run ``roundup-admin help commands`` for a complete list of subcommands.
