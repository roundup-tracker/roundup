What does Roundup install?
==========================

There's two "installations" that we talk about when using Roundup:

1. The installation of the software and its support files. This uses the
   standard Python mechanism called "distutils" and thus Roundup's core code,
   executable scripts and support data files are installed in Python's
   directories. On Windows, this is typically:

   Scripts
     ``<python dir>\scripts\...``
   Core code
     ``<python dir>\lib\site-packages\roundup\...``
   Support files
     ``<python dir>\share\roundup\...``

   and on Unix-like systems (eg. Linux):

   Scripts
     ``<python root>/bin/...``
   Core code
     ``<python root>/lib-<python version>/site-packages/roundup/...``
   Support files
     ``<python root>/share/roundup/...``

2. The installation of a specific tracker. When invoking the roundup-admin
   "inst" (and "init") commands, you're creating a new Roundup tracker. This
   installs configuration files, HTML templates, detector code and a new
   database. You have complete control over where this stuff goes through
   both choosing your "tracker home" and the DATABASE variable in
   config.py.


Users and Security
==================

Roundup holds its own user database which primarily contains a username,
password and email address for the user. Roundup *must* have its own user
listing, in order to maintain internal consistency of its data. It is a
relatively simple exercise to update this listing on a regular basis, or on
demand, so that it matches an external listing (eg. unix passwd file, LDAP,
etc.)

Roundup identifies users in a number of ways:

1. Through the web, users may be identified by either HTTP Basic
   Authentication or cookie authentication. If you are running the web
   server (roundup-server) through another HTTP server (eg. apache or IIS)
   then that server may require HTTP Basic Authentication, and it will pass
   the ``REMOTE_USER`` variable through to Roundup. If this variable is not
   present, then Roundup defaults to using its own cookie-based login
   mechanism.
2. In email messages handled by roundup-mailgw, users are identified by the
   From address in the message.

In both cases, Roundup's behaviour when dealing with unknown users is
controlled by Permissions defined in the "SECURITY SETTINGS" section of the
tracker's ``dbinit.py`` module:

Web Registration
  If granted to the Anonymous Role, then anonymous users will be able to
  register through the web.
Email Registration
  If granted to the Anonymous Role, then email messages from unknown users
  will result in those users being registered with the tracker.

More information about how to customise your tracker's security settings
may be found in the `customisation documentation`_.

Tasks
=====

Maintenance of Roundup can involve one of the following:

1. `tracker backup`_ 
2. `software upgrade`_
3. `migrating backends`_
4. `moving a tracker`_


Tracker Backup
--------------

Stop the web and email frontends and to copy the contents of the tracker home
directory to some other place using standard backup tools.


Software Upgrade
----------------

Always make a backup of your tracker before upgrading software. Steps you may
take:

1. Ensure that the unit tests run on your system::

    python run_tests.py

2. If you're using an RDBMS backend, make a backup of its contents now.
3. Make a backup of the tracker home itself.
4. Stop the tracker web and email frontends.
5. Follow the steps in the `upgrading documentation`_ for the new version of
   the software in the copied.
6. You may test each of the admin tool, web interface and mail gateway using
   the new version of the software. To do this, invoke the scripts directly
   in the source directory with::

    PYTHONPATH=. python roundup/scripts/roundup_server.py <normal arguments>
    PYTHONPATH=. python roundup/scripts/roundup_admin.py <normal arguments>
    PYTHONPATH=. python roundup/scripts/roundup_mailgw.py <normal arguments>

   Note that on Windows, this would read::

    C:\sources\roundup-0.7.4> SET PYTHONPATH=.
    C:\sources\roundup-0.7.4> python roundup/scripts/roundup_server.py <normal arguments>

7. Once you're comfortable that the upgrade will work using that copy, you
   should the installed software::

    python setup.py install

8. Restart your tracker web and email frontends.

If something bad happens, you may reinstate your backup of the tracker and
reinstall the older version of the sofware using the same install command::

    python setup.py install


Migrating Backends
------------------

1. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes)
2. use the roundup-admin tool "export" command to export the contents of
   your tracker to disk
3. copy the tracker home to a new directory
4. change the backend used in the tracker home ``select_db.py`` file
5. delete the "db" directory from the new directory
6. use the roundup-admin "import" command to import the previous export with
   the new tracker home
7. test each of the admin tool, web interface and mail gateway using the new
   backend
8. move the old tracker home out of the way (rename to "tracker.old") and 
   move the new tracker home into its place
9. restart web and email frontends


Moving a Tracker
----------------

If you're moving the tracker to a similar machine, you should:

1. install Roundup on the new machine and test that it works there,
2. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes),
3. copy the tracker home directory over to the new machine, and
4. start the tracker web and email frontends on the new machine.

Most of the backends are actually portable across platforms (ie. from Unix to
Windows to Mac). If this isn't the case (ie. the tracker doesn't work when
moved using the above steps) then you'll need to:

1. install Roundup on the new machine and test that it works there,
2. stop the existing tracker web and email frontends (preventing changes),
3. use the roundup-admin tool "export" command to export the contents of
   the existing tracker,
4. copy the export to the new machine,
5. use the roundup-admin "import" command to import the tracker on the new
   machine, and
6. start the tracker web and email frontends on the new machine.


Running the Servers
===================

Unix
----

On Unix systems, use the scripts/server-ctl script to control the
roundup-server server. Copy it somewhere and edit the variables at the top
to reflect your specific installation.


Windows
-------

On Windows, the roundup-server program runs as a Windows Service, and 
therefore may be controlled through the Services control panel. The
roundup-server program may also control the service directly:

**install the service**
  ``roundup-server -c install``
**start the service**
  ``roundup-server -c start``
**stop the service**
  ``roundup-server -c stop``

To bring up the services panel:

Windows 2000 and later
  Start/Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Services
Windows NT4
  Start/Control Panel/Services

Running the Mail Gateway Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mail gateway script should be scheduled to run regularly on your
Windows server. Normally this will result in a window popping up. The
solution to this is to:

1. Create a new local account on the Roundup server
2. Set the scheduled task to run in the context of this user instead
   of your normal login
