Roundup Features
================

Roundup is an easy-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
web, e-mail and command-line interfaces. Based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the :index:`Software Carpentry` "Track" design competition.

**Installation and Setup**

- Start using the software in `instant-gratification (demo) mode`_ with
  ``python demo.py`` or `a Docker container`_ in under 5 minutes. 
- Choose from `five included templates`_ for your tracker.
- `Customize`_ and use the demo as a template for your production tracker.
- No need for additional support software, just Python (3.6+ or 2.7)
  to get started.
- Basic installation (including a web interface) takes about 30 minutes.
- Supports embedded databases like `SQLite`_ and dbm. Upgradable
  to databases like `MySQL`_ or `PostgreSQL`_ if needed.
- Can be run in a container like Docker or kubernetes.
- Deploy in your network as a standalone web server or `through
  various methods`_ like WSGI, FastCGI, plain CGI, etc.

**Issue Tracking and Management**

- Manage your issues your way. Handle bugs, features, milestones, 
  user feedback, fleet maintenance, office issues etc.
- Searches on specific properties (e.g. open issues with a high
  priority) can be saved and reused or shared with outer users.
- Full Text Search for quick searches across messages.
- Keeps a detailed history of issue changes.
- Issues become a mini mailing list to keep everyone informed.
- Email is a first class method for interacting with issues.

**Scalability and Performance**

- Default trackers use simple HTML with low resource requirements.
- Fast and scalable with sqlite, mysql, and postgresql backends.
- Indexes are automatically configured.
- Supports full-text indexing engines (xapian, whoosh, SQLite,
  PostgreSQL) for large trackers.

**Customization**

- The database schema can be updated to `track additional data`_.
- The web interface can be redesigned to fit your workflow.
- Extensible web interface with various features like `wizards`_,
  bug displays, etc.
- Add business rules using `auditors and reactors`_ for actions before
  and after database changes.
- Comprehensive documentation for customization, installation,
  maintenance, and user guidance.

**Data Security, Privacy and Authorization**

- Your data remains on your servers.
- You can choose if AI can access the data.
- Can use HTTPS for security over the web.
- Fine-grained authorization (ABAC, PEBAC) based on user and resource
  properties.

**Documentation and User Management**

- Users can sign up through the web interface or new user creation
  can be limited to admin users.
- Can use an `external user database`_ (LDAP, password file)
- Self-server password reset for users via email.

**Email Integration and Automation**

- Update issues via email with new messages and the ability to
  change properties of issues (e.g. close an issue).
- Secure email handling with features like TLS, APOP, IMAPS/OAUTH.
- Optional auto-registration for email users.
- Configurable nosy list for each issue controls email notifications.
- Proper handling of email attachments and content types.

**Command-Line and API Access**

- Manage database interactively from the command line.
- Automate modifications using standard shell scripting.
- Python programs can use the Roundup Python API to manage/automate issues.
- Sample scripts provided for various tasks.

**Remote Access Interfaces**

- `XMLRPC interface`_ for remote tracker access with basic
  HTTP authentication.
- `RESTful API`_ accessible with basic HTTP authentication or optional JWT.
- Configurable CORS support for third-party web pages.
- Ability to generate and authenticate JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
