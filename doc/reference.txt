.. admonition:: Welcome

  This document used to be part of the `customization document`_.  The
  customization document was getting large and unwieldy.  It was a
  combination of examples and internal information that made finding
  information difficult. We often had questions on the mailing list that
  were well answered in the customization document, but finding the info
  was difficult.

  The documentation is slowly being reorganized using the `Diataxis
  framework`_. Help with the reorganization is welcome.

  This is the document you should look at for background on a tutorial
  or how-to guide in the customization document.

Tracker Configuration
=====================

The ``config.ini`` located in your tracker home contains the basic
configuration for the web and e-mail components of Roundup's interfaces.

Changes to the data captured by your tracker is controlled by the `tracker
schema`_.  Some configuration is also performed using permissions - see the 
`security / access controls`_ section. For example, to allow users to
automatically register through the email interface, you must grant the
"Anonymous" Role the "Email Access" Permission.

.. index::
   single: config.ini; sections
   see: configuration; config.ini

The following is taken from the `Python Library Reference`__ (July 18, 2018)
section "ConfigParser -- Configuration file parser":

 The configuration file consists of sections, led by a [section] header
 and followed by name: value entries, with continuations in the style
 of RFC 822 (see section 3.1.1, “LONG HEADER FIELDS”); name=value is
 also accepted. Note that leading whitespace is removed from
 values. The optional values can contain format strings which refer to
 other values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT
 section. Additional defaults can be provided on initialization and
 retrieval. Lines beginning with '#' or ';' are ignored and may be
 used to provide comments.

 For example::

   [My Section]
   foodir = %(dir)s/whatever
   dir = frob

 would resolve the "%(dir)s" to the value of "dir" ("frob" in this case)
 resulting in "foodir" being "frob/whatever".

__ https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html

Example configuration settings are below. This is a partial
list. Documentation on all the settings is included in the
``config.ini`` file.
 
.. .comment out. file generation needs more work include:: tracker_config.txt

.. index:: config.ini; sections main

Section **main**
 database -- ``db``
  Database directory path. The path may be either absolute or relative
  to the directory containig this config file.

 templates -- ``html``
  Path to the HTML templates directory. The path may be either absolute
  or relative to the directory containing this config file.

 static_files -- default *blank*
  A list of space separated directory paths (or a single directory).
  These directories hold additional static files available via Web UI.
  These directories may contain sitewide images, CSS stylesheets etc. If
  a '-' is included, the list processing ends and the TEMPLATES
  directory is not searched after the specified directories.  If this
  option is not set, all static files are taken from the TEMPLATES
  directory.

 admin_email -- ``roundup-admin``
  Email address that roundup will complain to if it runs into trouble. If
  the email address doesn't contain an ``@`` part, the MAIL_DOMAIN defined
  below is used.

 dispatcher_email -- ``roundup-admin``
  The 'dispatcher' is a role that can get notified of new items to the
  database. It is used by the ERROR_MESSAGES_TO config setting. If the
  email address doesn't contain an ``@`` part, the MAIL_DOMAIN defined
  below is used.

 email_from_tag -- default *blank*
  Additional text to include in the "name" part of the From: address used
  in nosy messages. If the sending user is "Foo Bar", the From: line
  is usually: ``"Foo Bar" <issue_tracker@tracker.example>``
  the EMAIL_FROM_TAG goes inside the "Foo Bar" quotes like so:
  ``"Foo Bar EMAIL_FROM_TAG" <issue_tracker@tracker.example>``

 new_web_user_roles -- ``User``
  Roles that a user gets when they register with Web User Interface.
  This is a comma-separated list of role names (e.g. ``Admin,User``).

 new_email_user_roles -- ``User``
  Roles that a user gets when they register with Email Gateway.
  This is a comma-separated string of role names (e.g. ``Admin,User``).

 error_messages_to -- ``user``
  Send error message emails to the ``dispatcher``, ``user``, or ``both``?
  The dispatcher is configured using the DISPATCHER_EMAIL setting.
  Allowed values: ``dispatcher``, ``user``, or ``both``

 html_version -- ``html4``
  HTML version to generate. The templates are ``html4`` by default.
  If you wish to make them xhtml, then you'll need to change this
  var to ``xhtml`` too so all auto-generated HTML is compliant.
  Allowed values: ``html4``, ``xhtml``

 timezone -- ``0``
  Numeric timezone offset used when users do not choose their own
  in their settings.

 instant_registration -- ``yes``
  Register new users instantly, or require confirmation via
  email?
  Allowed values: ``yes``, ``no``

 email_registration_confirmation -- ``yes``
  Offer registration confirmation by email or only through the web?
  Allowed values: ``yes``, ``no``

 indexer_stopwords -- default *blank*
  Additional stop-words for the full-text indexer specific to
  your tracker. See the indexer source for the default list of
  stop-words (e.g. ``A,AND,ARE,AS,AT,BE,BUT,BY, ...``).

 umask -- ``02``
  Defines the file creation mode mask.

 csv_field_size -- ``131072``
  Maximum size of a csv-field during import. Roundup's export
  format is a csv (comma separated values) variant. The csv
  reader has a limit on the size of individual fields
  starting with python 2.5. Set this to a higher value if you
  get the error 'Error: field larger than field limit' during
  import.

.. index:: config.ini; sections tracker

Section **tracker**
 name -- ``Roundup issue tracker``
  A descriptive name for your Roundup instance.

 web -- ``http://host.example/demo/``
  The web address that the tracker is viewable at.
  This will be included in information sent to users of the tracker.
  The URL MUST include the cgi-bin part or anything else
  that is required to get to the home page of the tracker.
  You MUST include a trailing '/' in the URL.

 email -- ``issue_tracker``
  Email address that mail to Roundup should go to.

 language -- default *blank*
  Default locale name for this tracker. If this option is not set, the
  language is determined by the environment variable LANGUAGE, LC_ALL,
  LC_MESSAGES, or LANG, in that order of preference.

.. index:: config.ini; sections web

Section **web**
 allow_html_file -- ``no``
  Setting this option enables Roundup to serve uploaded HTML
  file content *as HTML*. This is a potential security risk
  and is therefore disabled by default. Set to 'yes' if you
  trust *all* users uploading content to your tracker.

 http_auth -- ``yes``
  Whether to use HTTP Basic Authentication, if present.
  Roundup will use either the REMOTE_USER or HTTP_AUTHORIZATION
  variables supplied by your web server (in that order).
  Set this option to 'no' if you do not wish to use HTTP Basic
  Authentication in your web interface.

 use_browser_language -- ``yes``
  Whether to use HTTP Accept-Language, if present.
  Browsers send a language-region preference list.
  It's usually set in the client's browser or in their
  Operating System.
  Set this option to 'no' if you want to ignore it.

 debug -- ``no``
  Setting this option makes Roundup display error tracebacks
  in the user's browser rather than emailing them to the
  tracker admin."),

.. index:: config.ini; sections rdbms
   single: config.ini; database settings

Section **rdbms**
 Settings in this section are used to set the backend and configure
 addition settings needed by RDBMs like SQLite, Postgresql and
 MySQL backends.

  port 5432 (if any), for MySQL default port number is 3306. Leave this
  option empty to use backend default.

 user -- ``roundup``
  Database user name that Roundup should use.

 password -- ``roundup``
  Database user password.

 read_default_file -- ``~/.my.cnf``
  Name of the MySQL defaults file. Only used in MySQL connections.

  data in memory.

.. index:: config.ini; sections logging
   see: logging; config.ini, sections logging

Section **logging**
 config -- default *blank*
  Path to configuration file for standard Python logging module. If this
  option is set, logging configuration is loaded from specified file;
  options 'filename' and 'level' in this section are ignored. The path may
  be either absolute or relative to the directory containig this config file.

 filename -- default *blank*
  Log file name for minimal logging facility built into Roundup.  If no file
  name specified, log messages are written on stderr. If above 'config'
  option is set, this option has no effect. The path may be either absolute
  or relative to the directory containig this config file.

 level -- ``ERROR``
  Minimal severity level of messages written to log file. If above 'config'
  option is set, this option has no effect.
  Allowed values: ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``

.. index:: config.ini; sections mail

Section **mail**
 Outgoing email options. Used for nosy messages, password reset and
 registration approval requests.

 domain -- ``localhost``
  Domain name used for email addresses.

 host -- default *blank*
  SMTP mail host that Roundup will use to send mail

 username -- default *blank*
  SMTP login name. Set this if your mail host requires authenticated access.
  If username is not empty, password (below) MUST be set!

 password -- default *blank*
  SMTP login password.
  Set this if your mail host requires authenticated access.

 port -- default *25*
  SMTP port on mail host.
  Set this if your mail host runs on a different port.

 local_hostname -- default *blank*
  The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to use during SMTP sessions. If left
  blank, the underlying SMTP library will attempt to detect your FQDN. If your
  mail host requires something specific, specify the FQDN to use.

 tls -- ``no``
  If your SMTP mail host provides or requires TLS (Transport Layer Security)
  then you may set this option to 'yes'.
  Allowed values: ``yes``, ``no``

 tls_keyfile -- default *blank*
  If TLS is used, you may set this option to the name of a PEM formatted
  file that contains your private key. The path may be either absolute or
  relative to the directory containig this config file.

 tls_certfile -- default *blank*
  If TLS is used, you may set this option to the name of a PEM formatted
  certificate chain file. The path may be either absolute or relative
  to the directory containig this config file.

 charset -- utf-8
  Character set to encode email headers with. We use utf-8 by default, as
  it's the most flexible. Some mail readers (eg. Eudora) can't cope with
  that, so you might need to specify a more limited character set
  (eg. iso-8859-1).

 debug -- default *blank*
  Setting this option makes Roundup to write all outgoing email messages
  to this file *instead* of sending them. This option has the same effect
  as environment variable SENDMAILDEBUG. Environment variable takes
  precedence. The path may be either absolute or relative to the directory
  containig this config file.

 add_authorinfo -- ``yes``
  Add a line with author information at top of all messages send by
  Roundup.

 add_authoremail -- ``yes``
  Add the mail address of the author to the author information at the
  top of all messages.  If this is false but add_authorinfo is true,
  only the name of the actor is added which protects the mail address
  of the actor from being exposed at mail archives, etc.

.. index:: config.ini; sections mailgw
   single: mailgw; config
   see: mail gateway; mailgw

Section **mailgw**
 Roundup Mail Gateway options

 keep_quoted_text -- ``yes``
  Keep email citations when accepting messages. Setting this to ``no`` strips
  out "quoted" text from the message. Signatures are also stripped.
  Allowed values: ``yes``, ``no``

 leave_body_unchanged -- ``no``
  Preserve the email body as is - that is, keep the citations *and*
  signatures.
  Allowed values: ``yes``, ``no``

 default_class -- ``issue``
  Default class to use in the mailgw if one isn't supplied in email subjects.
  To disable, leave the value blank.

 language -- default *blank*
  Default locale name for the tracker mail gateway.  If this option is
  not set, mail gateway will use the language of the tracker instance.

 subject_prefix_parsing -- ``strict``
  Controls the parsing of the [prefix] on subject lines in incoming emails.
  ``strict`` will return an error to the sender if the [prefix] is not
  recognised. ``loose`` will attempt to parse the [prefix] but just
  pass it through as part of the issue title if not recognised. ``none``
  will always pass any [prefix] through as part of the issue title.

 subject_suffix_parsing -- ``strict``
  Controls the parsing of the [suffix] on subject lines in incoming emails.
  ``strict`` will return an error to the sender if the [suffix] is not
  recognised. ``loose`` will attempt to parse the [suffix] but just
  pass it through as part of the issue title if not recognised. ``none``
  will always pass any [suffix] through as part of the issue title.

 subject_suffix_delimiters -- ``[]``
  Defines the brackets used for delimiting the commands suffix in a subject
  line.

 subject_content_match -- ``always``
  Controls matching of the incoming email subject line against issue titles
  in the case where there is no designator [prefix]. ``never`` turns off
  matching. ``creation + interval`` or ``activity + interval`` will match
  an issue for the interval after the issue's creation or last activity.
  The interval is a standard Roundup interval.

 subject_updates_title -- ``yes``
  Update issue title if incoming subject of email is different.
  Setting this to ``no`` will ignore the title part of
  the subject of incoming email messages.

 refwd_re -- ``(\s*\W?\s*(fw|fwd|re|aw|sv|ang)\W)+``
  Regular expression matching a single reply or forward prefix
  prepended by the mailer. This is explicitly stripped from the
  subject during parsing.  Value is Python Regular Expression
  (UTF8-encoded).

 origmsg_re -- `` ^[>|\s]*-----\s?Original Message\s?-----$``
  Regular expression matching start of an original message if quoted
  in the body.  Value is Python Regular Expression (UTF8-encoded).

 sign_re -- ``^[>|\s]*-- ?$``
  Regular expression matching the start of a signature in the message
  body.  Value is Python Regular Expression (UTF8-encoded).

 eol_re -- ``[\r\n]+``
  Regular expression matching end of line.  Value is Python Regular
  Expression (UTF8-encoded).

 blankline_re -- ``[\r\n]+\s*[\r\n]+``
  Regular expression matching a blank line.  Value is Python Regular
  Expression (UTF8-encoded).

 ignore_alternatives -- ``no``
  When parsing incoming mails, Roundup uses the first
  text/plain part it finds. If this part is inside a
  multipart/alternative, and this option is set, all other
  parts of the multipart/alternative are ignored. The default
  is to keep all parts and attach them to the issue.

.. index:: config.ini; sections php

Section **pgp**
 OpenPGP mail processing options

 enable -- ``no``
  Enable PGP processing. Requires gpg.

 roles -- default *blank*
  If specified, a comma-separated list of roles to perform PGP
  processing on. If not specified, it happens for all users.

 homedir -- default *blank*
  Location of PGP directory. Defaults to $HOME/.gnupg if not
  specified.


.. index:: config.ini; sections nosy

Section **nosy**
 Nosy messages sending

 messages_to_author -- ``no``
  Send nosy messages to the author of the message.
  If ``yes`` is used, then messages are sent to the author
  even if not on the nosy list, same for ``new`` (but only for new messages).
  When set to ``nosy``, the nosy list controls sending messages to the author.
  Allowed values: ``yes``, ``no``, ``new``, ``nosy``

 signature_position -- ``bottom``
  Where to place the email signature.
  Allowed values: ``top``, ``bottom``, ``none``

 add_author -- ``new``
  Does the author of a message get placed on the nosy list automatically?
  If ``new`` is used, then the author will only be added when a message
  creates a new issue. If ``yes``, then the author will be added on
  followups too. If ``no``, they're never added to the nosy.
  Allowed values: ``yes``, ``no``, ``new``
  
 add_recipients -- ``new``
  Do the recipients (``To:``, ``Cc:``) of a message get placed on the nosy
  list?  If ``new`` is used, then the recipients will only be added when a
  message creates a new issue. If ``yes``, then the recipients will be added
  on followups too. If ``no``, they're never added to the nosy.
  Allowed values: ``yes``, ``no``, ``new``

 email_sending -- ``single``
  Controls the email sending from the nosy reactor. If ``multiple`` then
  a separate email is sent to each recipient. If ``single`` then a single
  email is sent with each recipient as a CC address.

 max_attachment_size -- ``2147483647``
  Attachments larger than the given number of bytes won't be attached
  to nosy mails. They will be replaced by a link to the tracker's
  download page for the file.


.. index:: single: roundup-admin; config.ini update
           single: roundup-admin; config.ini create
           single: config.ini; create
           single: config.ini; update

You may generate a new default config file using the ``roundup-admin
genconfig`` command. You can generate a new config file merging in
existing settings using the ``roundup-admin updateconfig`` command.

Configuration variables may be referred to in lower or upper case. In code,
variables not in the "main" section are referred to using their section and
name, so "domain" in the section "mail" becomes MAIL_DOMAIN.

.. index:: pair: configuration; extensions
   pair: configuration; detectors

Extending the configuration file
--------------------------------

You can't add new variables to the config.ini file in the tracker home but
you can add two new config.ini files:

- a config.ini in the ``extensions`` directory will be loaded and attached
  to the config variable as "ext".
- a config.ini in the ``detectors`` directory will be loaded and attached
  to the config variable as "detectors".

For example, the following in ``detectors/config.ini``::

    [main]
    qa_recipients = email@example.com

is accessible as::

    db.config.detectors['QA_RECIPIENTS']

Note that the name grouping applied to the main configuration file is
applied to the extension config files, so if you instead have::

    [qa]
    recipients = email@example.com

then the above ``db.config.detectors['QA_RECIPIENTS']`` will still work.

Unlike values in the tracker's main ``config.ini``, the values defined
in these config files are not validated. For example: a setting that
is supposed to be an integer value (e.g. 4) could be the word
"foo". If you are writing Python code that uses these settings, you
should expect to handle invalid values.

Also, incorrect values aren't discovered until the config setting is
used. This can be long after the tracker is started and the error may
not be seen in the logs.

It is possible to validate these settings. Validation involves calling
the ``update_options`` method on the configuration option. This can be
done from the ``init()`` function in the Python files implementing
extensions_ or detectors_.

As an example, adding the following to an extension::

   from roundup.configuration import SecretMandatoryOption

   def init(instance):
       instance.config.ext.update_option('RECAPTCHA_SECRET',
           SecretMandatoryOption,description="Secret securing reCaptcha.")

similarly for a detector::

   from roundup.configuration import MailAddressOption

   def init(db):
       try:
           db.config.detectors.update_option('QA_RECIPIENTS',
               MailAddressOption,
	       description="Email used for QA comment followup.")
       except KeyError:
           # COMMENT_EMAIL setting is not found, but it's optional
	   # so continue
           pass

will allow reading the secret from a file or append the tracker domain
to an email address if it does not have a domain.

Running ``roundup-admin -i tracker_home display user1`` will validate
the settings for both config.ini`s. Otherwise detector options are not
validated until the first request to the web interface (or email
gateway).

There are 4 arguments for ``update_option``:

1. config setting name - string (positional, mandatory)
2. option type - Option derived class from configuration.py
   (positional, mandatory)
3. default value - string (optional, named default) 
4. description - string (optional, named description) 

The first argument is the config setting name as described at the
beginning of this section.

The second argument is a class in the roundup.configuration module.
There are a number of these classes: BooleanOption,
IntegerNumberOption, RegExpOption.... Please see the configuration
module for all Option validators and their descriptions. You can also
define your own custom validator in `interfaces.py`_.

The third and fourth arguments are strings and are optional. They are
printed if there is an error and may help the user correct the problem.

.. index:: ! schema

Tracker Schema
==============

.. note::
   if you modify the schema, you'll most likely need to edit the
   `web interface`_ HTML template files and `detectors`_ to reflect
   your changes.

A tracker schema defines what data is stored in the tracker's database.
Schemas are defined using Python code in the ``schema.py`` module of your
tracker.

What you can/can't do to the schema
-----------------------------------

Your schema may be changed at any time before or after the tracker has been
initialised (or used). You may:

**Add new properties to classes, or add whole new classes**
  This is painless and easy to do - there are generally no repercussions
  from adding new information to a tracker's schema.

**Remove properties**
  Removing properties is a little more tricky - you need to make sure that
  the property is no longer used in the `web interface`_ *or* by the
  detectors_.

You must never:

**Remove the user class**
  This class is the only *required* class in Roundup.

**Remove the "username", "address", "password" or "realname" user properties**
  Various parts of Roundup require these properties. Don't remove them.

**Change the type of a property**
  Property types must *never* [1]_ be changed - the database simply
  doesn't take this kind of action into account. Note that you can't
  just remove a property and re-add it as a new type either. If you
  wanted to make the assignedto property a Multilink, you'd need to
  create a new property assignedto_list and remove the old assignedto
  property.

.. [1] If you shut down the tracker, `export the database`_, modify the
       exported csv property data to be compatible with the new type,
       change the property type in the schema, and finally import the
       changed exported data, you can change the property type. It is
       not trivial nor for the faint of heart. But it can be done.

.. _export the database: admin_guide.html#using-roundup-admin

The ``schema.py`` and ``initial_data.py`` modules
-------------------------------------------------

The schema.py module is used to define what your tracker looks like
on the inside, the schema of the tracker. It defines the Classes
and properties on each class. It also defines the security for
those Classes. The next few sections describe how schemas work
and what you can do with them.

The initial_data.py module sets up the initial state of your
tracker. It’s called exactly once - by the ``roundup-admin initialise``
command. See the start of the section on `database content`_ for more
info about how this works.

.. index:: schema; classic - description of

The "classic" schema
--------------------

The "classic" schema looks like this (see section `setkey(property)`_
below for the meaning of ``'setkey'`` -- you may also want to look into
the sections `setlabelprop(property)`_ and `setorderprop(property)`_ for
specifying (default) labelling and ordering of classes.)::

    pri = Class(db, "priority", name=String(), order=String())
    pri.setkey("name")

    stat = Class(db, "status", name=String(), order=String())
    stat.setkey("name")

    keyword = Class(db, "keyword", name=String())
    keyword.setkey("name")

    user = Class(db, "user", username=String(), organisation=String(),
        password=String(), address=String(), realname=String(),
        phone=String(), alternate_addresses=String(),
        queries=Multilink('query'), roles=String(), timezone=String())
    user.setkey("username")

    msg = FileClass(db, "msg", author=Link("user"), summary=String(),
        date=Date(), recipients=Multilink("user"),
        files=Multilink("file"), messageid=String(), inreplyto=String())

    file = FileClass(db, "file", name=String())

    issue = IssueClass(db, "issue", keyword=Multilink("keyword"),
        status=Link("status"), assignedto=Link("user"),
        priority=Link("priority"))
    issue.setkey('title')

.. index:: schema; allowed changes

Classes and Properties - creating a new information store
---------------------------------------------------------

In the tracker above, we've defined 7 classes of information:

  priority
      Defines the possible levels of urgency for issues.

  status
      Defines the possible states of processing the issue may be in.

  keyword
      Initially empty, will hold keywords useful for searching issues.

  user
      Initially holding the "admin" user, will eventually have an entry
      for all users using Roundup.

  msg
      Initially empty, will hold all e-mail messages sent to or
      generated by Roundup.

  file
      Initially empty, will hold all files attached to issues.

  issue
      Initially empty, this is where the issue information is stored.

We define the "priority" and "status" classes to allow two things:

  1. reduction in the amount of information stored on the issue
  2. more powerful, accurate searching of issues by priority and status

By only requiring a link on the issue (which is stored as a single
number) we reduce the chance that someone mis-types a priority or
status - or simply makes a new one up.

Class names are used to access items of that class in the `REST api`_
interface. The classic tracker was created before the REST interface
was added. It uses the single form (i.e. issue and user not issues and
users) for its classes. Most REST documentation suggests using plural
forms. However, to make your API consistent, use singular forms for
classes that you add.

Class and Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Class defines a particular class (or type) of data that will be stored
in the database. A class comprises one or more properties, which gives
the information about the class items.

The actual data entered into the database, using ``class.create()``, are
called items. They have a special immutable property called ``'id'``. We
sometimes refer to this as the *itemid*.


.. index:: schema; property types

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

A Class is comprised of one or more properties of the following types:

String
     properties are for storing arbitrary-length strings.
Password
     properties are for storing encoded arbitrary-length strings.
     The default encoding is defined on the ``roundup.password.Password``
     class.
Date
     properties store date-and-time stamps. Their values are Timestamp
     objects.
Interval
     properties store time periods rather than absolute dates. For
     example 2 hours.
Integer
     properties store integer values. (Number can store real/float values.)
Number
     properties store numeric values. There is an option to use
     double-precision floating point numbers.
Boolean
     properties store on/off, yes/no, true/false values.
Link
     properties refers to a single other item selected from a
     specified class. The class is part of the property; the value is an
     integer, the id of the chosen item.
Multilink
     properties refer to possibly many items in a specified
     class. The value is a list of integers.

Properties can have additional attributes to change the default
behaviour:

.. index:: triple: schema; property attributes; required
   triple: schema; property attributes; default_value
   triple: schema; property attributes; quiet

* All properties support the following attributes:

  - ``required``: see `design documentation`_. Adds the property to
    the list returned by calling get_required_props for the class.
  - ``default_value``: see `design documentation`_ Sets the default
    value if the property is not set.
  - ``quiet``: see `design documentation`_. Suppresses user visible
    to changes to this property. The property change is not reported:

    - in the change feedback/confirmation message in the web
      interface
    - the property change section of the nosy email
    - the web history at the bottom of an item's page

    This can be used to store state of the user interface (e.g. the
    names of elements that are collapsed or hidden from the
    user). Making properties that are updated as an indirect result of
    a user's change (e.g. updating a blockers property, counting
    number of times an issue was reopened or reassigned etc.) should
    not be displayed to the user as they can be confusing.

.. index:: triple: schema; property attributes; indexme

* String properties can have an ``indexme`` attribute that defines if the
  property should be part of the full text index. The default is 'no' but this
  can be set to 'yes' to allow a property's contents to be in the full
  text index.

.. index:: triple: schema; property attributes; use_double

* Number properties can have a ``use_double`` attribute that, when set
  to ``True``, will use double precision floating point in the database.
* Link and Multilink properties can have several attributes:

  .. index:: triple: schema; property attributes; do_journal  

  - ``do_journal``: By default, every change of a link property is
    recorded in the item being linked to (or being unlinked). A typical
    use-case for setting ``do_journal='no'`` would be to turn off
    journalling of nosy list, message author and message recipient link
    and unlink events to prevent the journal from clogged with these
    events.

  .. index:: triple: schema; property attributes; try_id_parsing

  - ``try_id_parsing`` is turned on by default. If entering a number
    into a Link or Multilink field, Roundup interprets this number as an
    ID of the item to link to. Sometimes items can have numeric names
    (like, e.g., product codes). For these Roundup needs to match the
    numeric name and should never match an ID. In this case you can set
    ``try_id_parsing='no'``.

  .. index:: triple: schema; property attributes; rev_multilink

  - The ``rev_multilink`` option takes a property name to be inserted
    into the linked-to class. This property is a Multilink property that
    links back to the current class. The new Multilink is read-only (it
    is automatically modified if the Link or Multilink property defining
    it is modified). The new property can be used in normal searches
    using the "filter" method of the Class. This means it can be used
    like other Multilink properties when searching (in an index
    template) or via the REST and XMLRPC APIs.

    As a example, suppose you want to group multiple issues into a
    super issue. Each issue can be part of only one super issue. It is
    inefficient to find all of the issues that are part of the
    super issue by searching through all issues in the system looking
    at the part_of link property. To make this more efficient, you
    can declare an issue's part_of property as::

       issue = IssueClass(db, "issue",
                 ...
		 part_of = Link("issue", rev_multilink="components"),
		 ... )

    This automatically creates the ``components`` multilink on the issue
    class. The ``components`` multilink is never explicitly declared in
    the issue class, but it has the same effect as though you had
    declared the class as::

       issue = IssueClass(db, "issue",
                 ...
		 part_of = Link("issue"),
		 components = Multilink("issue"),
		 ... )

    Then wrote a detector to update the components property on the
    corresponding issue. Writing this detector can be tricky. There is
    one other difference, you can not explicitly set/modify the
    ``components`` multilink.

    The effect of setting ``part_of = 3456`` on issue1234
    automatically adds "1234" to the ``components`` property on
    issue3456. You can search the ``components`` multilink just like a
    regular multilink, but you can't explicitly assign to it.
    Another difference of reverse multilinks to normal multilinks
    is that when a linked node is retired, the node vanishes from the
    multilink, e.g. in the example above, if an issue with ``part_of``
    set to another issue is retired this issue vanishes from the
    ``components`` multilink of the other issue.

    You can also link between different classes. So you can modify
    the issue definition to include::

       issue = IssueClass(db, "issue",
                 ...
		 assigned_to = Link("user", rev_multilink="responsibleFor"),
		 ... )
   
    This makes it easy to list all issues that the user is responsible
    for (aka assigned_to).

  .. index:: triple: schema; property attributes; msg_header_property

  - The ``msg_header_property`` is used by the mail gateway when sending
    out messages. When a link or multilink property of an issue changes,
    Roundup creates email headers of the form::

        X-Roundup-issue-prop: value

    where ``value`` is the ``name`` property for the linked item(s).
    For example, if you have a multilink for attached_files in your
    issue, you will see a header::

        X-Roundup-issue-attached_files: MySpecialFile.doc, HisResume.txt

    when the class for attached files is defined as::

       file = FileClass(db, "file", name=String())

    ``MySpecialFile.doc`` is the name for the file object.

    If you have an ``assigned_to`` property in your issue class that
    links to the user class and you want to add a header::

        X-Roundup-issue-assigned_to: ...

    so that the mail recipients can filter emails where
    ``X-Roundup-issue-assigned_to: name`` that contains their
    username. The user class is defined as::

       user = Class(db, "user",
                username=String(),
                password=Password(),
                address=String(),
                realname=String(),
                phone=String(),
                organisation=String(),
                alternate_addresses=String(),
                queries=Multilink('query'),
                roles=String(),     # comma-separated string of Role names
                timezone=String())

    Because there is no ``name`` parameter for the user class, there
    will be no header. However setting::

       assigned_to=Link("user", msg_header_property="username")

    will make the mail gateway generate an ``X-Roundup-issue-assigned_to``
    using the username property of the linked user.

    Assume assigned_to for an issue is linked to the user with
    username=joe_user, setting::

        msg_header_property="username"

    for the assigned_to property will generated message headers of the
    form::

        X-Roundup-issue-assigned_to: joe_user

    for emails sent on issues where joe_user has been assigned to the issue.

    If this property is set to the empty string "", it will prevent
    the header from being generated on outgoing mail.

.. index:: triple: schema; class property; creator
   triple: schema; class property; creation
   triple: schema; class property; actor
   triple: schema; class property; activity

All Classes automatically have a number of properties by default:

*creator*
  Link to the user that created the item.
*creation*
  Date the item was created.
*actor*
  Link to the user that last modified the item.
*activity*
  Date the item was last modified.


.. index:: double: schema; class methods

Methods
~~~~~~~

All classes have the following methods.

.. index:: triple: schema; class method; setkey

setkey(property)
::::::::::::::::

.. index:: roundup-admin; setting assignedto on an issue

Select a String property of the class to be the key property. The key
property must be unique, and allows references to the items in the class
by the content of the key property. That is, we can refer to users by
their username: for example, let's say that there's an issue in Roundup,
issue 23. There's also a user, richard, who happens to be user 2. To
assign an issue to him, we could do either of::

     roundup-admin set issue23 assignedto=2

or::

     roundup-admin set issue23 assignedto=richard

Note, the same thing can be done in the web and e-mail interfaces. 

.. index:: triple: schema; class method; setlabelprop

setlabelprop(property)
::::::::::::::::::::::

Select a property of the class to be the label property. The label
property is used whereever an item should be uniquely identified, e.g.,
when displaying a link to an item. If setlabelprop is not specified for
a class, the following values are tried for the label: 

* the key of the class (see the `setkey(property)`_ section above)
* the "name" property
* the "title" property
* the first property from the sorted property name list

So in most cases you can get away without specifying setlabelprop
explicitly.

You should make sure that users have View access to this property or
the id property for a class. If the property can not be viewed by a
user, looping over items in the class (e.g. messages attached to an
issue) will not work.

.. index:: triple: schema; class method; setorderprop

setorderprop(property)
::::::::::::::::::::::

Select a property of the class to be the order property. The order
property is used whenever using a default sort order for the class,
e.g., when grouping or sorting class A by a link to class B in the user
interface, the order property of class B is used for sorting.  If
setorderprop is not specified for a class, the following values are tried
for the order property:

* the property named "order"
* the label property (see `setlabelprop(property)`_ above)

So in most cases you can get away without specifying setorderprop
explicitly.

.. index:: triple: schema; class method; create

create(information)
:::::::::::::::::::

Create an item in the database. This is generally used to create items
in the :term:`definitional class` like "priority" and "status".

IssueClass
~~~~~~~~~~

IssueClasses automatically include the "messages", "files", "nosy", and
"superseder" properties.

The messages and files properties list the links to the messages and
files related to the issue. The nosy property is a list of links to
users who wish to be informed of changes to the issue - they get "CC'ed"
e-mails when messages are sent to or generated by the issue. The nosy
reactor (in the ``'detectors'`` directory) handles this action. The
superseder link indicates an issue which has superseded this one.

They also have the dynamically generated "creation", "activity" and
"creator" properties.

The value of the "creation" property is the date when an item was
created, and the value of the "activity" property is the date when any
property on the item was last edited (equivalently, these are the dates
on the first and last records in the item's journal). The "creator"
property holds a link to the user that created the issue.

.. index:: triple: schema; class property; content
   triple: schema; class property; type

FileClass
~~~~~~~~~

FileClasses save their "content" attribute off in a separate file from
the rest of the database. This reduces the number of large entries in
the database, which generally makes databases more efficient, and also
allows us to use command-line tools to operate on the files. They are
stored in the files sub-directory of the ``'db'`` directory in your
tracker. FileClasses also have a "type" attribute to store the MIME
type of the file.

Roundup by default considers the contents of the file immutable. This
is to assist in maintaining an accurate record of correspondence.  The
distributed tracker templates do not enforce this. So if you have
access to the Roundup tracker directory, you can edit the files (make
sure to preserve mode, owner and group) to remove information (e.g. if
somebody includes a password or you need to redact proprietary
information). Obviously the journal for the message/file will not
report that the file has changed.

Best practice is to remove offending material and leave a
placeholder. E.G. replace a password with the text::

    [password has been deleted 2020-12-02 --myname]

If you need to delete an entire file, replace the file contents with::

    [file contents deleted due to spam 2020-10-21 --myname]

rather than deleting the file. If you actually delete the file Roundup
will report an error to the user and email the administrator. If you
empty the file, a user downloading the file using the direct URL
(e.g. ``tracker/msg22``) may be confused and think something is broken
when they receive an empty file. Retiring a file/msg does not prevent
access to the file using the direct URL. Retiring an item only removes
it when requesting a list of all items in the class. If you are
replacing the contents, you probably want to change the content type
of the file. E.G. from ``image/jpeg`` to ``text/plain``. You can do
this easily through the web interface, or using the ``roundup-admin``
command line interface.

You can also change the contents of a file or message using the REST
interface. Note that this will NOT result in an entry in the journal,
so again it allows a silent change. To do this you need to make two
rest requests. An example using curl is::

   $ curl -u demo:demo -s
          -H "X-requested-with: rest" \
          -H "Referer:  https://tracker.example.com/demo/" \
          -X GET \
          https://tracker.example.com/demo/rest/data/file/30/content
   {
      "data": {
          "id": "30",
          "type": "<class 'str'>",
          "link": "https://tracker.example.com/demo/rest/data/file/30/content",
          "data": "hello3",
          "@etag": "\"3f2f8063dbce5b6bd43567e6f4f3c671\""
      }
   }

using the etag, overwrite the content with::

    $ curl -u demo:demo -s
          -H "X-requested-with: rest" \
          -H "Referer:  https://tracker.example.com/demo/" \
          -H 'If-Match: "3f2f8063dbce5b6bd43567e6f4f3c671"' \
          -X PUT \
          -F "data=@hello" \
          https://tracker.example.com/demo/rest/data/file/30/content

where ``hello`` is a file on local disk.

You can enforce immutability in your tracker by adding an auditor (see
detectors_) for the file/msg class that rejects changes to the content
property. The auditor could also add a journal entry so that a change
via the Roundup mechanism is reported.  Using a mixin (see:
https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/MixinClassFileClass) to augment the
file class allows for other possibilities including signing the file, or
recording a checksum in the database and validating the file contents
at the time it gets read. This allows detection of changes done on the
filesystem outside of the Roundup mechanism.

.. index:: schema; item ordering

A note about ordering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we sort items in the hyperdb, we use one of a number of methods,
depending on the properties being sorted on:

1. If it's a String, Integer, Number, Date or Interval property, we
   just sort the scalar value of the property. Strings are sorted
   case-sensitively.
2. If it's a Link property, we sort by either the linked item's "order"
   property (if it has one) or the linked item's "id".
3. Mulitlinks sort similar to #2, but we start with the first Multilink
   list item, and if they're the same, we sort by the second item, and
   so on.

Note that if an "order" property is defined on a Class that is used for
sorting, all items of that Class *must* have a value against the "order"
property, or sorting will result in random ordering.


Examples of adding to your schema
---------------------------------

Some examples are in the :ref:`CustomExamples` section.

Also you can start with `Roundup wiki CategorySchema`_ to see a list
of additional examples of how schemas can be customised to add new
functionality.

Detectors - adding behaviour to your tracker
============================================

Detectors are initialised every time you open your tracker database, so
you're free to add and remove them any time, even after the database is
initialised via the ``roundup-admin initialise`` command.

The detectors in your tracker fire *before* (**auditors**) and *after*
(**reactors**) changes to the contents of your database. They are Python
modules that sit in your tracker's ``detectors`` directory. You will
have some installed by default - have a look. You can write new
detectors or modify the existing ones. The existing detectors installed
for you are:

.. index:: detectors; installed

**nosyreaction.py**
  This provides the automatic nosy list maintenance and email sending.
  The nosy reactor (``nosyreaction``) fires when new messages are added
  to issues. The nosy auditor (``updatenosy``) fires when issues are
  changed, and figures out what changes need to be made to the nosy list
  (such as adding new authors, etc.)
**statusauditor.py**
  This provides the ``chatty`` auditor which changes the issue status
  from ``unread`` or ``closed`` to ``chatting`` if new messages appear.
  It also provides the ``presetunread`` auditor which pre-sets the
  status to ``unread`` on new items if the status isn't explicitly
  defined.
**messagesummary.py**
  Generates the ``summary`` property for new messages based on the message
  content.
**userauditor.py**
  Verifies the content of some of the user fields (email addresses and
  roles lists).

If you don't want this default behaviour, you're completely free to change
or remove these detectors.

See the detectors section in the `design document`__ for details of the
interface for detectors.

.. index:: detectors; writing api

Detector API
------------

.. index:: pair: detectors; auditors
   single: auditors; function signature
   single: auditors; defining
   single: auditors; arguments

Auditors are called with the arguments::

    audit(db, cl, itemid, newdata)

where ``db`` is the database, ``cl`` is an instance of Class or
IssueClass within the database, and ``newdata`` is a dictionary mapping
property names to values.

For a ``create()`` operation, the ``itemid`` argument is None and
newdata contains all of the initial property values with which the item
is about to be created.

For a ``set()`` operation, newdata contains only the names and values of
properties that are about to be changed.

For a ``retire()`` or ``restore()`` operation, newdata is None.

.. index:: pair: detectors; reactor
   single: reactors; function signature
   single: reactors; defining
   single: reactors; arguments

Reactors are called with the arguments::

    react(db, cl, itemid, olddata)

where ``db`` is the database, ``cl`` is an instance of Class or
IssueClass within the database, and ``olddata`` is a dictionary mapping
property names to values.

For a ``create()`` operation, the ``itemid`` argument is the id of the
newly-created item and ``olddata`` is None.

For a ``set()`` operation, ``olddata`` contains the names and previous
values of properties that were changed.

For a ``retire()`` or ``restore()`` operation, ``itemid`` is the id of
the retired or restored item and ``olddata`` is None.

.. index:: detectors; additional

Additional Detectors Ready For Use
----------------------------------

Sample additional detectors that have been found useful will appear in
the ``'detectors'`` directory of the Roundup distribution. If you want
to use one, copy it to the ``'detectors'`` of your tracker instance:

**irker.py**
  This detector sends notification on IRC through an irker daemon
  (http://www.catb.org/esr/irker/) when issues are created or messages
  are added.  In order to use it you need to install irker, start the
  irkerd daemon, and add an ``[irker]`` section in ``detectors/config.ini``
  that contains a comma-separated list of channels where the messages should
  be sent, e.g. ``channels = irc://chat.freenode.net/channelname``.
**newissuecopy.py**
  This detector sends an email to a team address whenever a new issue is
  created. The address is hard-coded into the detector, so edit it
  before you use it (look for the text 'team@team.host') or you'll get
  email errors!
**creator_resolution.py**
  Catch attempts to set the status to "resolved" - if the assignedto
  user isn't the creator, then set the status to "confirm-done". Note that
  "classic" Roundup doesn't have that status, so you'll have to add it. If
  you don't want to though, it'll just use "in-progress" instead.
**email_auditor.py**
  If a file added to an issue is of type message/rfc822, we tack on the
  extension .eml.
  The reason for this is that Microsoft Internet Explorer will not open
  things with a .eml attachment, as they deem it 'unsafe'. Worse yet,
  they'll just give you an incomprehensible error message. For more 
  information, see the detector code - it has a lengthy explanation.


.. index:: auditors; rules for use
   single: reactors; rules for use

Auditor or Reactor?
-------------------

Generally speaking, the following rules should be observed:

**Auditors**
  Are used for `vetoing creation of or changes to items`_. They might
  also make automatic changes to item properties.
**Reactors**
  Detect changes in the database and react accordingly. They should avoid
  making changes to the database where possible, as this could create
  detector loops.


Vetoing creation of or changes to items
---------------------------------------

Auditors may raise the ``Reject`` exception to prevent the creation of
or changes to items in the database.  The mail gateway, for example, will
not attach files or messages to issues when the creation of those files or
messages are prevented through the ``Reject`` exception. It'll also not create
users if that creation is ``Reject``'ed too.

To use, simply add at the top of your auditor::

   from roundup.exceptions import Reject

And then when your rejection criteria have been detected, simply::

   raise Reject('Description of error')

Error messages raised with ``Reject`` automatically have any HTML content
escaped before being displayed to the user. To display an error message to the
user without performing any HTML escaping the ``RejectRaw`` should be used. All
security implications should be carefully considering before using
``RejectRaw``.


Generating email from Roundup
-----------------------------

The module ``roundup.mailer`` contains most of the nuts-n-bolts required
to generate email messages from Roundup.

In addition, the ``IssueClass`` methods ``nosymessage()`` and
``send_message()`` are used to generate nosy messages, and may generate
messages which only consist of a change note (ie. the message id parameter
is not required - this is referred to as a "System Message" because it
comes from "the system" and not a user).


.. index:: extensions
.. index:: extensions; add python functions to tracker
.. _extensions:
.. _actions:

Extensions - adding capabilities to your tracker
================================================

While detectors_ add new behavior by reacting to changes in tracked
objects, `extensions` add new actions and utilities to Roundup, which
are mostly used to enhance web interface.

You can create an extension by creating Python file in your tracker
``extensions`` directory.  All files from this dir are loaded when
tracker instance is created, at which point it calls ``init(instance)``
from each file supplying itself as a first argument.

Note that at this point web interface is not loaded, but extensions still
can register actions for in tracker instance. This may be fixed in
Roundup 1.6 by introducing ``init_web(client)`` callback or a more
flexible extension point mechanism.

* ``instance.registerUtil`` is used for adding `templating utilities`_
  (see `adding a time log to your issues
  <customizing.html#adding-a-time-log-to-your-issues-4>`_ for an example)

* ``instance.registerAction`` is used to add more actions to instance
  and to web interface. See `Defining new web actions`_ for details.
  Generic action can be added by inheriting from ``action.Action``
  instead of ``cgi.action.Action``.

.. _interfaces.py:
.. _modifying the core of Roundup:

interfaces.py - hooking into the core of Roundup
================================================

There is a magic trick for hooking into the core of Roundup. Using
this you can:

* modify class data structures
* monkey patch core code to add new functionality
* modify the email gateway
* add new rest endpoints
* enable experimental or future features

but with great power comes great responsibility.

Interfaces.py has been around since the earliest releases of Roundup
and used to be the main way to get a lot of customization done. In
modern Roundup, the extensions_ mechanism is used to `add actions
<#defining-new-web-actions>`_ and `templating utilities`_. But there are
places where interfaces.py is still useful. Note that the tracker
directories are not on the Python system path when interfaces.py is
evaluated. You need to add library directories explictly by
modifying sys.path.

See `Changing How the Core Code Works
<customizing.html#changing-how-the-core-code-works>`_ for examples.

Database Content
================

.. note::
   If you modify the content of a :term:`definitional class`, you will
   need to edit the tracker `detectors`_ if they reference a value of
   a definitional class. (E.g. if a detector checks to see if an issue
   has a status of "open", and you change the "open" definition to be
   "working", you need to change the check.)

Customisation of the special :term:`definitional classes <definitional
class>` (eg. status,
priority, resolution, ...) may be done either before or after the
tracker is initialised. The actual method of doing so is completely
different in each case though, so be careful to use the right one.

**Changing content before tracker initialisation**
    Edit the initial_data.py module in your tracker to alter the items
    created using the ``create( ... )`` methods.

**Changing content after tracker initialisation**
    As the "admin" user, click on the "class list" link in the web
    interface to bring up a list of all database classes. Click on the
    name of the class you wish to change the content of.

    You may also use the ``roundup-admin`` interface's create, set and
    retire methods to add, alter or remove items from the classes in
    question.

See "`adding a new field to the classic schema
<customizing.html#adding-a-new-field-to-the-classic-schema>`_" for an
example that requires database content changes.


Security / Access Controls
==========================

A set of Permissions is built into the security module by default. For
each Class defined in the tracker schema, the following permissions
are defined:

- Create (everything)
- Edit (everything)
- Search (everything) - (used if View does not permit access)
- Retire (everything)
- Restore (everything)
- View (everything)

All of these are assigned to the "Admin" Role by default for every
class. They allow a user to do anything. The web and email interfaces
also define:

Email Access
  If defined, the user may use the email interface. Used by default to deny
  Anonymous users access to the email interface. When granted to the
  Anonymous user, they will be automatically registered by the email
  interface (see also the ``new_email_user_roles`` configuration option).

Web Access
  If defined, the user may use the web interface. This is usually
  assigned to the Anonymous role as well to allow authorized users to
  access the form based login. If some other authorization mode (basic
  auth, SSO, etc.) is used Web Access can be removed from the
  Anonymous user.

Web Roles
  Controls user access to editing the "roles" property of the "user" class.
  TODO: deprecate in favour of a property-based control.

Rest Access |br| Xmlrpc Access
  These control access to the Rest and Xmlrpc endpoints. The Admin and User
  roles have these by default in the classic tracker. See the
  `directions in the rest interface documentation`_ and the
  `xmlrpc interface documentation`_.

Register
  This is assigned to the anonymous user and allows automatic user
  registration by email or web.

These are hooked into the default Roles:

- Admin (Create, Edit, Retire, Restore, Search, View for everything; Web Roles)
- User (Web Access; Email Access)
- Anonymous (Web Access)

Finally, the "admin" user gets the "Admin" Role, and the "anonymous"
user gets the "Anonymous" Role assigned when the tracker is installed.

For the "User" Role, the "classic" tracker defines:

- Create, Edit and View issue, file, msg, query, keyword 
- View priority, status
- View user
- Edit their own user record

And the "Anonymous" Role is defined as:

- Web interface access
- Register user (for registration)
- View issue, file, msg, query, keyword, priority, status

Put together, these settings appear in the tracker's ``schema.py`` file::

.. index::
   single: roundup-admin; view class permissions

You can use ``roundup-admin security`` to verify the permissions
defined in the schema. It also verifies that properties specified in
permissions are valid for the class. This helps detect typos that can
cause baffling permission issues.

Automatic Permission Checks
---------------------------

Permissions are automatically checked when information is rendered
through the web. This includes:

1. View checks for properties when being rendered via the ``plain()`` or
   similar methods. If the check fails, the text "[hidden]" will be
   displayed.
2. Edit checks for properties when the edit field is being rendered via
   the ``field()`` or similar methods. If the check fails, the property
   will be rendered via the ``plain()`` method (see point 1. for subsequent
   checking performed)
3. View checks are performed in index pages for each item being displayed
   such that if the user does not have permission, the row is not rendered.
4. View checks are performed at the top of item pages for the Item being
   displayed. If the user does not have permission, the text "You are not
   allowed to view this page." will be displayed.
5. View checks are performed at the top of index pages for the Class being
   displayed. If the user does not have permission, the text "You are not
   allowed to view this page." will be displayed.


New User Roles
--------------

New users are assigned the Roles defined in the config file as:

- NEW_WEB_USER_ROLES
- NEW_EMAIL_USER_ROLES

The `users may only edit their issues
<customizing.html#users-may-only-edit-their-issues>`_ example shows
customisation of these parameters.


Changing Access Controls
------------------------

You may alter the configuration variables to change the Role that new
web or email users get, for example to not give them access to the web
interface if they register through email. 

You may use the ``roundup-admin`` "``security``" command to display the
current Role and Permission configuration in your tracker.


Adding a new Permission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When adding a new Permission, you will need to:

1. add it to your tracker's ``schema.py`` so it is created, using
   ``security.addPermission``, for example::

    db.security.addPermission(name="View", klass='frozzle',
        description="User is allowed to access frozzles")

   will set up a new "View" permission on the Class "frozzle".
2. enable it for the Roles that should have it (verify with
   "``roundup-admin security``")
3. add it to the relevant HTML interface templates
4. add it to the appropriate xxxPermission methods on in your tracker
   interfaces module

The ``addPermission`` method takes a few optional parameters:

**properties**
  A sequence of property names that are the only properties to apply the
  new Permission to (eg. ``... klass='user', properties=('name',
  'email') ...``)
**props_only**
  A boolean value (set to false by default) that is a new feature
  in Roundup 1.6.
  A permission defined using:

     ``properties=('list', 'of', 'property', 'names')``

  is used to determine access for things other than just those
  properties. For example a check for View permission on the issue
  class or an issue item can use any View permission for the issue
  class even if that permission has a property list.  This can be
  confusing and surprising as you would think that a permission
  including properties would be used only for determining the
  access permission for those properties.

  ``roundup-admin security`` will report invalid properties for the
  class. For example a permission with an invalid summary property is
  presented as::

     Allowed to see content of object regardless of spam status
        (View for "file": ('content', 'summary') only)

     **Invalid properties for file: ['summary']

  Setting ``props_only=True`` will make the permission valid only for
  those properties.

  If you use a lot of permissions with property checks, it can be
  difficult to change all of them. Calling the function:

    db.security.set_props_only_default(True)

  at the top of ``schema.py`` will make every permission creation
  behave as though props_only was set to True. It is expected that the
  default of True will become the default in a future Roundup release.
**check**
  A function to be executed which returns boolean determining whether
  the Permission is allowed. If it returns True, the permission is
  allowed, if it returns False the permission is denied.  The function
  can have one of two signatures::

     check(db, userid, itemid)

  or::

     check(db, userid, itemid, **ctx)

  where ``db`` is a handle on the open database, ``userid`` is
  the user attempting access and ``itemid`` is the specific item being
  accessed. If the second form is used the ``ctx`` dictionary is
  defined with the following values::

     ctx['property'] the name of the property being checked or None if
            it's a class check.

     ctx['classname'] the name of the class that is being checked
            (issue, query ....).

     ctx['permission'] the name of the permission (e.g. View, Edit...).

The second form is preferred as it makes it easier to implement more
complex permission schemes. An `example in upgrading.html
<upgrading.html#enhancement-to-check-command-for-permissions>`_
shows the use of ``ctx``.

Example Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the `examples <customizing.html#examples>`_ section for longer
examples of customisation.

**anonymous access through the e-mail gateway**
 Give the "anonymous" user the "Email Access", ("Edit", "issue") and
 ("Create", "msg") Permissions but do not not give them the ("Create",
 "user") Permission. This means that when an unknown user sends email
 into the tracker, they're automatically logged in as "anonymous".
 Since they don't have the ("Create", "user") Permission, they won't
 be automatically registered, but since "anonymous" has permission to
 use the gateway, they'll still be able to submit issues. Note that
 the Sender information - their email address - will not be available
 - they're *anonymous*.

**automatic registration of users in the e-mail gateway**
 By giving the "anonymous" user the ("Register", "user") Permission, any
 unidentified user will automatically be registered with the tracker
 (with no password, so they won't be able to log in through
 the web until an admin sets their password). By default new Roundup
 trackers don't allow this as it opens them up to spam. It may be enabled
 by uncommenting the appropriate addPermissionToRole in your tracker's
 ``schema.py`` file. The new user is given the Roles list defined in the
 "new_email_user_roles" config variable. 

**only developers may be assigned issues**
 Create a new Permission called "Fixer" for the "issue" class. Create a
 new Role "Developer" which has that Permission, and assign that to the
 appropriate users. Filter the list of users available in the assignedto
 list to include only those users. Enforce the Permission with an
 auditor. See the example 
 `restricting the list of users that are assignable to a task
 <customizing.html#restricting-the-list-of-users-that-are-assignable-to-a-task>`_.

**only managers may sign off issues as complete**
 Create a new Permission called "Closer" for the "issue" class. Create a
 new Role "Manager" which has that Permission, and assign that to the
 appropriate users. In your web interface, only display the "resolved"
 issue state option when the user has the "Closer" Permissions. Enforce
 the Permission with an auditor. This is very similar to the previous
 example, except that the web interface check would look like::

   <option tal:condition="python:request.user.hasPermission('Closer')"
           value="resolved">Resolved</option>
 
**don't give web access to users who register through email**
 Create a new Role called "Email User" which has all the Permissions of
 the normal "User" Role minus the "Web Access" Permission. This will
 allow users to send in emails to the tracker, but not access the web
 interface.

**let some users edit the details of all users**
 Create a new Role called "User Admin" which has the Permission for
 editing users::

    db.security.addRole(name='User Admin', description='Managing users')
    p = db.security.getPermission('Edit', 'user')
    db.security.addPermissionToRole('User Admin', p)

 and assign the Role to the users who need the permission.


Web Interface
=============

.. contents::
   :local:

The web interface is provided by the ``roundup.cgi.client`` module and
is used by ``roundup.cgi``, ``roundup-server`` and ``ZRoundup``
(``ZRoundup``  is broken, until further notice). In all cases, we
determine which tracker is being accessed (the first part of the URL
path inside the scope of the CGI handler) and pass control on to the
``roundup.cgi.client.Client`` class - which handles the rest of the
access through its ``main()`` method. This means that you can do pretty
much anything you want as a web interface to your tracker.



Repercussions of changing the tracker schema
---------------------------------------------

If you choose to change the `tracker schema`_ you will need to ensure
the web interface knows about it:

1. Index, item and search pages for the relevant classes may need to
   have properties added or removed,
2. The "page" template may require links to be changed, as might the
   "home" page's content arguments.


How requests are processed
--------------------------

The basic processing of a web request proceeds as follows:

1. figure out who we are, defaulting to the "anonymous" user
2. figure out what the request is for - we call this the "context"
3. handle any requested action (item edit, search, ...)
4. render the template requested by the context, resulting in HTML
   output

In some situations, exceptions occur:

- HTTP Redirect  (generally raised by an action)
    the URL to redirect to is the first argument of the exception.
- SendFile       (generally raised by ``determine_context``)
    here we serve up a FileClass "content" property
- SendStaticFile (generally raised by ``determine_context``)
    here we serve up a file from the tracker "html" directory
- Unauthorised   (generally raised by an action)
    here the action is cancelled, the request is rendered and an error
    message is displayed indicating that permission was not granted for
    the action to take place
- NotFound       (raised wherever it needs to be)
    this exception percolates up to the CGI interface that called the
    client


Roundup URL design
------------------

Each tracker has several hardcoded URLs. These three are equivalent and
lead to the main tracker page:

1. ``/``
2. ``/index``
3. ``/home``

The following prefix is used to access static resources:

4. ``/@@file/``

Two additional url's are used for the API's.
The `REST api`_ is accessed via:
 
5. ``/rest/``

.. _`REST api`: rest.html

and the `XMLRPC api`_ is available at:

6. ``/xmlrpc``

.. _`XMLRPC api`: xmlrpc.html

All other URLs depend on the classes configured in Roundup database.
Each class receives two URLs - one for the class itself and another
for specific items of that class. Example for class URL:

7. ``/issue``

This is usually used to show listings of class items. The URL for
for specific object of issue class with id 1 will look like:

8. ``/issue1``

.. _strip_zeros:

Note that a leading string of 0's will be stripped from the id part of
the object :term:`designator` in the URL. E.G. ``/issue001`` is the
same as ``/issue1``.  Similarly for ``/file01`` etc. However you
should generate URL's without the extra zeros.

Determining web context
-----------------------

To determine the "context" of a request (what request is for), we look at
the URL path after the tracker root and at ``@template`` request
parameter. Typical URL paths look like:

1.  ``/tracker/issue``
2.  ``/tracker/issue1``
3.  ``/tracker/@@file/style.css``
4.  ``/cgi-bin/roundup.cgi/tracker/file1``
5.  ``/cgi-bin/roundup.cgi/tracker/file1/kitten.png``

where tracker root is ``/tracker/`` or ``/cgi-bin/roundup.cgi/tracker/``
We're looking at "issue", "issue1", "@@file/style.css", "file1" and
"file1/kitten.png" in the cases above.

1. with is no path we are in the "home" context. See `the "home"
   context`_ below for details. "index" or "home" paths may also be used
   to switch into "home" context.
2. for paths starting with "@@file" the additional path entry ("style.css"
   in the example above) specifies the static file to be served
   from the tracker TEMPLATES directory (or STATIC_FILES, if configured).
   This is usually the tracker's "html" directory. Internally this works
   by raising SendStaticFile exception.
3. if there is something in the path (as in example 1, "issue"), it
   identifies the tracker class to display.
4. if the path is an item designator (as in examples 2 and 4, "issue1"
   and "file1"), then we're to display a specific item.
   :ref:`Note. <strip_zeros>`
5. if the path starts with an item designator and is longer than one
   entry (as in example 5, "file1/kitten.png"), then we're assumed to be
   handling an item of a ``FileClass``, and the extra path information
   gives the filename that the client is going to label the download
   with (i.e. "file1/kitten.png" is nicer to download than "file1").
   This raises a ``SendFile`` exception.

Neither 2. or 5. use templates and stop before the template is
determined. For other contexts the template used is specified by the
``@template`` variable, which defaults to:

- only classname supplied:       "index"
- full item designator supplied: "item"


The "home" Context
------------------

The "home" context is special because it allows you to add templated
pages to your tracker that don't rely on a class or item (ie. an issues
list or specific issue).

Let's say you wish to add frames to control the layout of your tracker's
interface. You'd probably have:

- A top-level frameset page. This page probably wouldn't be templated, so
  it could be served as a static file (see `serving static content`_)
- A sidebar frame that is templated. Let's call this page
  "home.navigation.html" in your tracker's "html" directory. To load that
  page up, you use the URL::

    <tracker url>/home?@template=navigation


Serving static content
----------------------

See the previous section `determining web context`_ where it describes
``@@file`` paths.

These files are served without any permission checks. Any user on the
internet with the url can download the file.

This is rarely an issue since the html templates are just source code
and much of it can be found in the Roundup repository. Other
decoration (logos, stylesheets) are similarly not security sensitive.
You can use the static_files setting in config.ini to eliminate
access to the templates directory if desired.

If a file resolves to a symbolic link, it is not served.

Performing actions in web requests
----------------------------------

When a user requests a web page, they may optionally also request for an
action to take place. As described in `how requests are processed`_, the
action is performed before the requested page is generated. Actions are
triggered by using a ``@action`` CGI variable, where the value is one
of:

**login**
 Attempt to log a user in.

**logout**
 Log the user out - make them "anonymous".

**register**
 Attempt to create a new user based on the contents of the form and then
 log them in.

**edit**
 Perform an edit of an item in the database. There are some `special form
 variables`_ you may use. Also you can set the ``__redirect_to`` form
 variable to the URL that should be displayed after the edit is succesfully
 completed. If you wanted to edit a sequence of issues, users etc. this
 could be used to display the next item in the sequence to the user. 

**new**
 Add a new item to the database. You may use the same `special form
 variables`_ as in the "edit" action. Also you can set the
 ``__redirect_to`` form variable to the URL that should be displayed after
 the new item is created. This is useful if you want to create another
 item rather than edit the newly created item.

**retire**
 Retire the item in the database.

**editCSV**
 Performs an edit of all of a class' items in one go. See also the
 *class*.csv templating method which generates the CSV data to be
 edited, and the ``'_generic.index'`` template which uses both of these
 features.

**search**
 Mangle some of the form variables:

 - Set the form ":filter" variable based on the values of the filter
   variables - if they're set to anything other than "dontcare" then add
   them to :filter.

 - Also handle the ":queryname" variable and save off the query to the
   user's query list.

Each of the actions is implemented by a corresponding ``*XxxAction*`` (where
"Xxx" is the name of the action) class in the ``roundup.cgi.actions`` module.
These classes are registered with ``roundup.cgi.client.Client``. If you need
to define new actions, you may add them there (see `defining new
web actions`_).

Each action class also has a ``*permission*`` method which determines whether
the action is permissible given the current user. The base permission checks
for each action are:

**login**
 Determine whether the user has the "Web Access" Permission.
**logout**
 No permission checks are made.
**register**
 Determine whether the user has the ("Create", "user") Permission.
**edit**
 Determine whether the user has permission to edit this item. If we're
 editing the "user" class, users are allowed to edit their own details -
 unless they try to edit the "roles" property, which requires the
 special Permission "Web Roles".
**new**
 Determine whether the user has permission to create this item. No
 additional property checks are made. Additionally, new user items may
 be created if the user has the ("Create", "user") Permission.
**editCSV**
 Determine whether the user has permission to edit this class.
**search**
 Determine whether the user has permission to view this class.

Protecting users from web application attacks
---------------------------------------------

There is a class of attacks known as Cross Site Request Forgeries
(CSRF). Malicious code running in the browser can making a
request to Roundup while you are logged into Roundup.  The
malicious code piggy backs on your existing Roundup session to
make changes without your knowledge. Roundup 1.6 has support for
defending against this by analyzing the

* Referer,
* Origin, and
* Host or 
* X-Forwarded-Host

HTTP headers. It compares the headers to the value of the web setting
in the [tracker] section of the tracker's ``config.ini``.

Also a per form token (also called a nonce) can be enabled for
the tracker using the ``csrf_enforce_token`` option in
config.ini.  When enabled, Roundup will validate a hidden form
field called ``@csrf``. If the validation fails (or the token
is used more than once) the request is rejected.  The ``@csrf``
input field is added automatically by calling the ``submit``
function/path. It can also be added manually by calling
anti_csrf_nonce() directly. For example::

   <input name="@csrf" type="hidden"
      tal:attributes="value python:utils.anti_csrf_nonce(lifetime=10)">

By default a nonce lifetime is 2 weeks. However the lifetime (in
minutes) can be set by passing a lifetime argument as shown
above. The example above makes the nonce lifetime 10 minutes.
 
Search for @csrf in this document for more examples. There are
more examples and information in ``upgrading.txt``.

The token protects you because malicious code supplied by another
site is unable to obtain the token. Thus many attempts they make
to submit a request are rejected.

The protection on the xmlrpc interface is untested, but is based
on a valid header check against the Roundup url and the presence
of the ``X-REQUESTED-WITH`` header. Work to improve this is a
future project after the 1.6 release.

The enforcement levels can be modified in ``config.ini``. Refer to
that file for details.

Special form variables
----------------------

Item properties and their values are edited with html FORM
variables and their values. You can:

- Change the value of some property of the current item.
- Create a new item of any class, and edit the new item's
  properties,
- Attach newly created items to a multilink property of the
  current item.
- Remove items from a multilink property of the current item.
- Specify that some properties are required for the edit
  operation to be successful.
- Redirect to a different page after creating a new item (new action
  only, not edit action). Usually you end up on the page for the
  created item.
- Set up user interface locale.

These operations will only take place if the form action (the
``@action`` variable) is "edit" or "new".

In the following, <bracketed> values are variable, "@" may be
either ":" or "@", and other text "required" is fixed.

Two special form variables are used to specify user language preferences:

``@language``
  value may be locale name or ``none``. If this variable is set to
  locale name, web interface language is changed to given value
  (provided that appropriate translation is available), the value
  is stored in the browser cookie and will be used for all following
  requests.  If value is ``none`` the cookie is removed and the
  language is changed to the tracker default, set up in the tracker
  configuration or OS environment.

``@charset``
  value may be character set name or ``none``.  Character set name
  is stored in the browser cookie and sets output encoding for all
  HTML pages generated by Roundup.  If value is ``none`` the cookie
  is removed and HTML output is reset to Roundup internal encoding
  (UTF-8).

Most properties are specified as form variables:

``<propname>``
  property on the current context item

``<designator>"@"<propname>``
  property on the indicated item (for editing related information)

Designators name a specific item of a class.

``<classname><N>``
    Name an existing item of class <classname>.

``<classname>"-"<N>``
    Name the <N>th new item of class <classname>. If the form
    submission is successful, a new item of <classname> is
    created. Within the submitted form, a particular
    designator of this form always refers to the same new
    item.

Once we have determined the "propname", we look at it to see
if it's special:

``@required``
    The associated form value is a comma-separated list of
    property names that must be specified when the form is
    submitted for the edit operation to succeed.  

    When the <designator> is missing, the properties are
    for the current context item.  When <designator> is
    present, they are for the item specified by
    <designator>.

    The "@required" specifier must come before any of the
    properties it refers to are assigned in the form.

``@remove@<propname>=id(s)`` or ``@add@<propname>=id(s)``
    The "@add@" and "@remove@" edit actions apply only to
    Multilink properties.  The form value must be a
    comma-separate list of keys for the class specified by
    the simple form variable.  The listed items are added
    to (respectively, removed from) the specified
    property.

``@link@<propname>=<designator>``
    If the edit action is "@link@", the simple form
    variable must specify a Link or Multilink property.
    The form value is a comma-separated list of
    designators.  The item corresponding to each
    designator is linked to the property given by simple
    form variable.

None of the above (ie. just a simple form value)
    The value of the form variable is converted
    appropriately, depending on the type of the property.

    For a Link('klass') property, the form value is a
    single key for 'klass', where the key field is
    specified in schema.py.  

    For a Multilink('klass') property, the form value is a
    comma-separated list of keys for 'klass', where the
    key field is specified in schema.py.  

    Note that for simple-form-variables specifiying Link
    and Multilink properties, the linked-to class must
    have a key field.

    For a String() property specifying a filename, the
    file named by the form value is uploaded. This means we
    try to set additional properties "filename" and "type" (if
    they are valid for the class).  Otherwise, the property
    is set to the form value.

    For Date(), Interval(), Boolean(), Integer() and Number()
    properties, the form value is converted to the
    appropriate value.

Any of the form variables may be prefixed with a classname or
designator.

Setting the form variable: ``__redirect_to=`` to a url when
@action=new redirects the user to the specified url after successfully
creating the new item. This is useful if you want the user to create
another item rather than edit the newly created item.  Note that the
url assigned to ``__redirect_to`` must be url encoded/quoted and be
under the tracker's base url. If the base_url uses http, you can set
the url to https.

Two special form values are supported for backwards compatibility:

@note
    This is equivalent to::

        @link@messages=msg-1
        msg-1@content=value

    which is equivalent to the html::

        <textarea name="msg-1@content"></textarea>
        <input type="hidden" name="@link@messages" value="msg-1">

    except that in addition, the "author" and "date" properties of
    "msg-1" are set to the userid of the submitter, and the current
    time, respectively.

@file
    This is equivalent to::

        @link@files=file-1
        file-1@content=value

    by adding the HTML::

        <input type="file" name="file-1@content">
        <input type="hidden" name="@link@files" value="file-1">

    The String content value is handled as described above for file
    uploads.

If both the "@note" and "@file" form variables are
specified, the action::

        msg-1@link@files=file-1

is also performed. This would be expressed in HTML with::

        <input type="hidden" name="msg-1@link@files" value="file-1">

We also check that FileClass items have a "content" property with
actual content, otherwise we remove them from all_props before
returning.


Default templates
-----------------

The default templates are html4 compliant. If you wish to change them to be
xhtml compliant, you'll need to change the ``html_version`` configuration
variable in ``config.ini`` to ``'xhtml'`` instead of ``'html4'``.

Most customisation of the web view can be done by modifying the
templates in the tracker ``'html'`` directory. There are several types
of files in there. The *minimal* template includes:

**page.html**
  This template usually defines the overall look of your tracker. When
  you view an issue, it appears inside this template. When you view an
  index, it also appears inside this template. This template defines a
  macro called "icing" which is used by almost all other templates as a
  coating for their content, using its "content" slot. It also defines
  the "head_title" and "body_title" slots to allow setting of the page
  title.
**home.html**
  the default page displayed when no other page is indicated by the user
**home.classlist.html**
  a special version of the default page that lists the classes in the
  tracker
**classname.item.html**
  displays an item of the *classname* class
**classname.index.html**
  displays a list of *classname* items
**classname.search.html**
  displays a search page for *classname* items
**_generic.index.html**
  used to display a list of items where there is no
  ``*classname*.index`` available
**_generic.help.html**
  used to display a "class help" page where there is no
  ``*classname*.help``
**user.register.html**
  a special page just for the user class, that renders the registration
  page
**style.css**
  a static file that is served up as-is

The *classic* template has a number of additional templates.

Remember that you can create any template extension you want to,
so if you just want to play around with the templating for new issues,
you can copy the current "issue.item" template to "issue.test", and then
access the test template using the "@template" URL argument::

   http://your.tracker.example/tracker/issue?@template=test

and it won't affect your users using the "issue.item" template.

You can also put templates into a subdirectory of the template
directory. So if you specify::

   http://your.tracker.example/tracker/issue?@template=test/item

you will use the template at: ``test/issue.item.html``. If that
template doesn't exit it will try to use
``test/_generic.item.html``. If that template doesn't exist
it will return an error.

Implementing Modal Editing Using @template
------------------------------------------

Many item templates allow you to edit the item. They contain
code that renders edit boxes if the user has edit permissions.
Otherwise the template will just display the item information.

In some cases you want to do a modal edit. The user has to take some
action (click a button or follow a link) to shift from display mode to
edit mode. When the changes are submitted, ending the edit mode,
the user is returned to display mode.

Modal workflows usually slow things down and are not implemented by
default templates. However for some workflows a modal edit is useful.
For example a batch edit mode that allows the user to edit a number of
issues all from one form could be implemented as a modal workflow of:

* search for issues to modify
* switch to edit mode and change values
* exit back to the results of the search

To implement the modal edit, assume you have an issue.edit.html
template that implements an edit form.  On the display page (a version
of issue.item.html modified to only display information) add a link
that calls the display url, but adds ``@template=edit`` to the link.

This will now display the edit page. On the edit page you want to add
a hidden text field to your form named ``@template`` with the value:
``item|edit``.  When the form is submitted it is validated. If the
form is correct the user will see the item rendered using the item
template. If there is an error (validation failed) the item will be
rendered using the edit template. The edit template that is rendered
will display all the changes that the user made to the form before it
was submitted. The user can correct the error and resubmit the changes
until the form validates.

If the form failed to validate but the ``@template`` field had the
value ``item`` the user would still see the error, but all of the data
the user entered would be discarded. The user would have to redo all
the edits again.


How the templates work
----------------------


Templating engines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since version 1.4.20 Roundup supports two templating engines:

* the original `Template Attribute Language`_ (TAL) engine from Zope
* the standalone Chameleon templating engine. Chameleon is intended
  as a replacement for the original TAL engine, and supports the
  same syntax, but they are not 100% compatible. The major (and most
  likely the only) incompatibility is the default expression type being
  ``python:`` instead of ``path:``. See also "Incompatibilities and
  differences" section of `Chameleon documentation`__.

Version 1.5.0 added experimental support for the `jinja2`_ templating
language. You must install the `jinja2`_ module in order to use it. The
``jinja2`` template supplied with Roundup has the templates rewritten
to use ``jinja2`` rather than TAL. A number of trackers are running
using ``jinja2`` templating so it is considered less experimental than
Chameleon templating.

.. _jinja2: https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/


**NOTE1**: For historical reasons, examples given below assumes path
expression as default expression type. With Chameleon you have to manually
resolve the path expressions. A Chameleon-based, z3c.pt, that is fully
compatible with the old TAL implementation, is planned to be included in a
future release.

**NOTE2**: As of 1.4.20 Chameleon support is highly experimental and **not**
recommended for production use.

Basic Templating Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Roundup's templates consist of special attributes on the HTML tags.
These attributes form the **Template Attribute Language**, or TAL.
The basic TAL commands are:

**tal:define="variable expression; variable expression; ..."**
   Define a new variable that is local to this tag and its contents. For
   example::

      <html tal:define="title request/description">
       <head><title tal:content="title"></title></head>
      </html>

   In this example, the variable "title" is defined as the result of the
   expression "request/description". The "tal:content" command inside the
   <html> tag may then use the "title" variable.

**tal:condition="expression"**
   Only keep this tag and its contents if the expression is true. For
   example::

     <p tal:condition="python:request.user.hasPermission('View', 'issue')">
      Display some issue information.
     </p>

   In the example, the <p> tag and its contents are only displayed if
   the user has the "View" permission for issues. We consider the number
   zero, a blank string, an empty list, and the built-in variable
   nothing to be false values. Nearly every other value is true,
   including non-zero numbers, and strings with anything in them (even
   spaces!).

**tal:repeat="variable expression"**
   Repeat this tag and its contents for each element of the sequence
   that the expression returns, defining a new local variable and a
   special "repeat" variable for each element. For example::

     <tr tal:repeat="u user/list">
      <td tal:content="u/id"></td>
      <td tal:content="u/username"></td>
      <td tal:content="u/realname"></td>
     </tr>

   The example would iterate over the sequence of users returned by
   "user/list" and define the local variable "u" for each entry. Using
   the repeat command creates a new variable called "repeat" which you
   may access to gather information about the iteration. See the section
   below on `the repeat variable`_.

**tal:replace="expression"**
   Replace this tag with the result of the expression. For example::

    <span tal:replace="request/user/realname" />

   The example would replace the <span> tag and its contents with the
   user's realname. If the user's realname was "Bruce", then the
   resultant output would be "Bruce".

**tal:content="expression"**
   Replace the contents of this tag with the result of the expression.
   For example::

    <span tal:content="request/user/realname">user's name appears here
    </span>

   The example would replace the contents of the <span> tag with the
   user's realname. If the user's realname was "Bruce" then the
   resultant output would be "<span>Bruce</span>".

**tal:attributes="attribute expression; attribute expression; ..."**
   Set attributes on this tag to the results of expressions. For
   example::

     <a tal:attributes="href string:user${request/user/id}">My Details</a>

   In the example, the "href" attribute of the <a> tag is set to the
   value of the "string:user${request/user/id}" expression, which will
   be something like "user123".

**tal:omit-tag="expression"**
   Remove this tag (but not its contents) if the expression is true. For
   example::

      <span tal:omit-tag="python:1">Hello, world!</span>

   would result in output of::

      Hello, world!

Note that the commands on a given tag are evaulated in the order above,
so *define* comes before *condition*, and so on.

Additionally, you may include tags such as <tal:block>, which are
removed from output. Its content is kept, but the tag itself is not (so
don't go using any "tal:attributes" commands on it). This is useful for
making arbitrary blocks of HTML conditional or repeatable (very handy
for repeating multiple table rows, which would otherwise require an
illegal tag placement to effect the repeat).


Templating Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Templating Expressions are covered by `Template Attribute Language
Expression Syntax`_, or TALES. The expressions you may use in the
attribute values may be one of the following forms:

**Path Expressions** - eg. ``item/status/checklist``
   These are object attribute / item accesses. Roughly speaking, the
   path ``item/status/checklist`` is broken into parts ``item``,
   ``status`` and ``checklist``. The ``item`` part is the root of the
   expression. We then look for a ``status`` attribute on ``item``, or
   failing that, a ``status`` item (as in ``item['status']``). If that
   fails, the path expression fails. When we get to the end, the object
   we're left with is evaluated to get a string - if it is a method, it
   is called; if it is an object, it is stringified. Path expressions
   may have an optional ``path:`` prefix, but they are the default
   expression type, so it's not necessary.

   If an expression evaluates to ``default``, then the expression is
   "cancelled" - whatever HTML already exists in the template will
   remain (tag content in the case of ``tal:content``, attributes in the
   case of ``tal:attributes``).

   If an expression evaluates to ``nothing`` then the target of the
   expression is removed (tag content in the case of ``tal:content``,
   attributes in the case of ``tal:attributes`` and the tag itself in
   the case of ``tal:replace``).

   If an element in the path may not exist, then you can use the ``|``
   operator in the expression to provide an alternative. So, the
   expression ``request/form/foo/value | default`` would simply leave
   the current HTML in place if the "foo" form variable doesn't exist.

   You may use the python function ``path``, as in
   ``path("item/status")``, to embed path expressions in Python
   expressions.

**String Expressions** - eg. ``string:hello ${user/name}`` 
   These expressions are simple string interpolations - though they can
   be just plain strings with no interpolation if you want. The
   expression in the ``${ ... }`` is just a path expression as above.

**Python Expressions** - eg. ``python: 1+1`` 
   These expressions give the full power of Python. All the "root level"
   variables are available, so ``python:item.status.checklist()`` would
   be equivalent to ``item/status/checklist``, assuming that
   ``checklist`` is a method.

Modifiers:

**structure** - eg. ``structure python:msg.content.plain(hyperlink=1)``
   The result of expressions are normally *escaped* to be safe for HTML
   display (all "<", ">" and "&" are turned into special entities). The
   ``structure`` expression modifier turns off this escaping - the
   result of the expression is now assumed to be HTML, which is passed
   to the web browser for rendering.

**not:** - eg. ``not:python:1=1``
   This simply inverts the logical true/false value of another
   expression.

.. _Template Attribute Language Expression Syntax:
   https://pagetemplates.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history/TALESSpecification13.html


Template Macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Macros are used in Roundup to save us from repeating the same common
page stuctures over and over. The most common (and probably only) macro
you'll use is the "icing" macro defined in the "page" template.

Macros are generated and used inside your templates using special
attributes similar to the `basic templating actions`_. In this case,
though, the attributes belong to the `Macro Expansion Template
Attribute Language`_, or METAL. The macro commands are:

**metal:define-macro="macro name"**
  Define that the tag and its contents are now a macro that may be
  inserted into other templates using the *use-macro* command. For
  example::

    <html metal:define-macro="page">
     ...
    </html>

  defines a macro called "page" using the ``<html>`` tag and its
  contents. Once defined, macros are stored on the template they're
  defined on in the ``macros`` attribute. You can access them later on
  through the ``templates`` variable, eg. the most common
  ``templates/page/macros/icing`` to access the "page" macro of the
  "page" template.

**metal:use-macro="path expression"**
  Use a macro, which is identified by the path expression (see above).
  This will replace the current tag with the identified macro contents.
  For example::

   <tal:block metal:use-macro="templates/page/macros/icing">
    ...
   </tal:block>

   will replace the tag and its contents with the "page" macro of the
   "page" template.

**metal:define-slot="slot name"** and **metal:fill-slot="slot name"**
  To define *dynamic* parts of the macro, you define "slots" which may
  be filled when the macro is used with a *use-macro* command. For
  example, the ``templates/page/macros/icing`` macro defines a slot like
  so::

    <title metal:define-slot="head_title">title goes here</title>

  In your *use-macro* command, you may now use a *fill-slot* command
  like this::

    <title metal:fill-slot="head_title">My Title</title>

  where the tag that fills the slot completely replaces the one defined
  as the slot in the macro.

Note that you may not mix `METAL`_ and `TAL`_ commands on the same tag, but
TAL commands may be used freely inside METAL-using tags (so your
*fill-slots* tags may have all manner of TAL inside them).

Information available to templates
----------------------------------

This is implemented by ``roundup.cgi.templating.RoundupPageTemplate``

The following variables are available to templates.

**context**
  The current context. This is either None, a `hyperdb class wrapper`_
  or a `hyperdb item wrapper`_

**request**
  Includes information about the current request, including:

  - the current index information (``filterspec``, ``filter``
    args, ``properties``, etc) parsed out of the form. 
  - methods for easy filterspec link generation
  - "form"
    The current CGI form information as a mapping of form argument name
    to value (specifically a cgi.FieldStorage)
  - "env" the CGI environment variables
  - "base" the base URL for this instance
  - "user" a HTMLItem instance for the current user
  - "language" as determined by the browser or config
  - "classname" the current classname (possibly None)
  - "template" the current template (suffix, also possibly None)
**config**
  This variable holds all the values defined in the tracker config.ini
  file (eg. TRACKER_NAME, etc.)
**db**
  The current database, used to access arbitrary database items.
**templates**
  Access to all the tracker templates by name. Used mainly in
  *use-macro* commands.
**utils**
  This variable makes available some utility functions like batching.
**nothing**
  This is a special variable - if an expression evaluates to this, then
  the tag (in the case of a ``tal:replace``), its contents (in the case
  of ``tal:content``) or some attributes (in the case of
  ``tal:attributes``) will not appear in the the output. So, for
  example::

    <span tal:attributes="class nothing">Hello, World!</span>

  would result in::

    <span>Hello, World!</span>

**default**
  Also a special variable - if an expression evaluates to this, then the
  existing HTML in the template will not be replaced or removed, it will
  remain. So::

    <span tal:replace="default">Hello, World!</span>

  would result in::

    <span>Hello, World!</span>

**true**, **false**
  Boolean constants that may be used in `templating expressions`_
  instead of ``python:1`` and ``python:0``.
**i18n**
  Internationalization service, providing two string translation methods:

  **gettext** (*message*)
    Return the localized translation of message
  **ngettext** (*singular*, *plural*, *number*)
    Like ``gettext()``, but consider plural forms. If a translation
    is found, apply the plural formula to *number*, and return the
    resulting message (some languages have more than two plural forms).
    If no translation is found, return singular if *number* is 1;
    return plural otherwise.

The context variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *context* variable is one of three things based on the current
context (see `determining web context`_ for how we figure this out):

1. if we're looking at a "home" page, then it's None
2. if we're looking at a specific hyperdb class, it's a
   `hyperdb class wrapper`_.
3. if we're looking at a specific hyperdb item, it's a
   `hyperdb item wrapper`_.

If the context is not None, we can access the properties of the class or
item. The only real difference between cases 2 and 3 above are:

1. the properties may have a real value behind them, and this will
   appear if the property is displayed through ``context/property`` or
   ``context/property/field``.
2. the context's "id" property will be a false value in the second case,
   but a real, or true value in the third. Thus we can determine whether
   we're looking at a real item from the hyperdb by testing
   "context/id".

Hyperdb class wrapper
:::::::::::::::::::::

This is implemented by the ``roundup.cgi.templating.HTMLClass``
class.

This wrapper object provides access to a hyperdb class. It is used
primarily in both index view and new item views, but it's also usable
anywhere else that you wish to access information about a class, or the
items of a class, when you don't have a specific item of that class in
mind.

We allow access to properties. There will be no "id" property. The value
accessed through the property will be the current value of the same name
from the CGI form.

There are several methods available on these wrapper objects:

=========== =============================================================
Method      Description
=========== =============================================================
properties  return a `hyperdb property wrapper`_ for all of this class's
            properties that are searchable by the user. You can use
            the argument cansearch=False to get all properties.
list        lists all of the active (not retired) items in the class.
csv         return the items of this class as a chunk of CSV text.
propnames   lists the names of the properties of this class.
filter      lists of items from this class, filtered and sorted. Two
            options are available for sorting:

            1. by the current *request* filterspec/filter/sort/group args
            2. by the "filterspec", "sort" and "group" keyword args.
               "filterspec" is ``{propname: value(s)}``. "sort" and
               "group" are an optionally empty list ``[(dir, prop)]``
               where dir is '+', '-' or None
               and prop is a prop name or None.

               The propname in filterspec and prop in a sort/group spec
               may be transitive, i.e., it may contain properties of
               the form link.link.link.name.

            eg. All issues with a priority of "1" with messages added in
            the last week, sorted by activity date:
            ``issue.filter(filterspec={"priority": "1",
            'messages.creation' : '.-1w;'}, sort=[('activity', '+')])``

            Note that when searching for Link and Multilink values, the
            special value '-1' searches for empty Link or Multilink
            values. For both, Links and Multilinks, multiple values
            given in a filter call are combined with 'OR' by default.
            For Multilinks a postfix expression syntax using negative ID
            numbers (as strings) as operators is supported. Each
            non-negative number (or '-1') is pushed on an operand stack.
            A negative number pops the required number of arguments from
            the stack, applies the operator, and pushes the result. The
            following operators are supported:

	    - '-2' stands for 'NOT' and takes one argument
	    - '-3' stands for 'AND' and takes two arguments
	    - '-4' stands for 'OR' and takes two arguments

	    Note that this special handling of ID arguments is applied only
	    when a negative number smaller than -1 is encountered as an ID
	    in the filter call. Otherwise the implicit OR default
            applies.
	    Examples of using Multilink expressions would be

	    - '1', '2', '-4', '3', '4', '-4', '-3'
	      would search for IDs (1 or 2) and (3 or 4)
	    - '-1' '-2' would search for all non-empty Multilinks

filter_sql  **Only in SQL backends**

            Lists the items that match the SQL provided. The SQL is a
            complete "select" statement.

            The SQL select must include the item id as the first column.

            This function **does not** filter out retired items, add
            on a where clause "__retired__ <> 1" if you don't want
            retired nodes.

classhelp   display a link to a javascript popup containing this class'
            "help" template.

            This generates a link to a popup window which displays the
            properties indicated by "properties" of the class named by
            "classname". The "properties" should be a comma-separated list
            (eg. 'id,name,description'). Properties defaults to all the
            properties of a class (excluding id, creator, created and
            activity).

            You may optionally override the "label" displayed, the "width",
            the "height", the number of items per page ("pagesize") and
            the field on which the list is sorted ("sort").

            With the "filter" arg it is possible to specify a filter for
            which items are supposed to be displayed. It has to be of
            the format "<field>=<values>;<field>=<values>;...".

            The popup window will be resizable and scrollable.

            If the "property" arg is given, it's passed through to the
            javascript help_window function. This allows updating of a
            property in the calling HTML page.

            If the "form" arg is given, it's passed through to the
            javascript help_window function - it's the name of the form
            the "property" belongs to.

submit      generate a submit button (and action and @csrf hidden elements)
renderWith  render this class with the given template.
history     returns 'New node - no history' :)
is_edit_ok  is the user allowed to Edit the current class?
is_view_ok  is the user allowed to View the current class?
=========== =============================================================

Note that if you have a property of the same name as one of the above
methods, you'll need to access it using a python "item access"
expression. For example::

   python:context['list']

will access the "list" property, rather than the list method.


Hyperdb item wrapper
::::::::::::::::::::

This is implemented by the ``roundup.cgi.templating.HTMLItem``
class.

This wrapper object provides access to a hyperdb item.

We allow access to properties. There will be no "id" property. The value
accessed through the property will be the current value of the same name
from the CGI form.

There are several methods available on these wrapper objects:

=============== ========================================================
Method          Description
=============== ========================================================
submit          generate a submit button (and action and @csrf hidden elements)
journal         return the journal of the current item (**not
                implemented**)
history         render the journal of the current item as
                HTML. By default properties marked as "quiet" (see 
		`design documentation`_) are not shown unless the
		function is called with the showall=True parameter.
		Properties that are not Viewable to the user are not
		shown.
renderQueryForm specific to the "query" class - render the search form
                for the query
hasPermission   specific to the "user" class - determine whether the
                user has a Permission. The signature is::

                    hasPermission(self, permission, [classname=],
                        [property=], [itemid=])

                where the classname defaults to the current context.
hasRole         specific to the "user" class - determine whether the
                user has a Role. The signature is::

                    hasRole(self, rolename)

is_edit_ok      is the user allowed to Edit the current item?
is_view_ok      is the user allowed to View the current item?
is_retired      is the item retired?
download_url    generate a url-quoted link for download of FileClass
                item contents (ie. file<id>/<name>)
copy_url        generate a url-quoted link for creating a copy
                of this item.  By default, the copy will acquire
                all properties of the current item except for
                ``messages`` and ``files``.  This can be overridden
                by passing ``exclude`` argument which contains a list
                (or any iterable) of property names that shall not be
                copied.  Database-driven properties like ``id`` or
                ``activity`` cannot be copied.
=============== ========================================================

Note that if you have a property of the same name as one of the above
methods, you'll need to access it using a python "item access"
expression. For example::

   python:context['journal']

will access the "journal" property, rather than the journal method.


Hyperdb property wrapper
::::::::::::::::::::::::

This is implemented by subclasses of the
``roundup.cgi.templating.HTMLProperty`` class (``HTMLStringProperty``,
``HTMLNumberProperty``, and so on).

This wrapper object provides access to a single property of a class. Its
value may be either:

1. if accessed through a `hyperdb item wrapper`_, then it's a value from
   the hyperdb
2. if access through a `hyperdb class wrapper`_, then it's a value from
   the CGI form


The property wrapper has some useful attributes:

=============== ========================================================
Attribute       Description
=============== ========================================================
_name           the name of the property
_value          the value of the property if any - this is the actual
                value retrieved from the hyperdb for this property
=============== ========================================================

There are several methods available on these wrapper objects:

=========== ================================================================
Method      Description
=========== ================================================================
plain       render a "plain" representation of the property. This method
            may take two arguments:

            escape
             If true, escape the text so it is HTML safe (default: no). The
             reason this defaults to off is that text is usually escaped
             at a later stage by the TAL commands, unless the "structure"
             option is used in the template. The following ``tal:content``
             expressions are all equivalent::
 
              "structure python:msg.content.plain(escape=1)"
              "python:msg.content.plain()"
              "msg/content/plain"
              "msg/content"

             Usually you'll only want to use the escape option in a
             complex expression.

            hyperlink
             If true, turn URLs, email addresses and hyperdb item
             designators in the text into hyperlinks (default: no). Note
             that you'll need to use the "structure" TAL option if you
             want to use this ``tal:content`` expression::
  
              "structure python:msg.content.plain(hyperlink=1)"

             The text is automatically HTML-escaped before the hyperlinking
             transformation done in the plain() method.

hyperlinked The same as msg.content.plain(hyperlink=1), but nicer::

              "structure msg/content/hyperlinked"

field       render an appropriate form edit field for the property - for
            most types this is a text entry box, but for Booleans it's a
            tri-state yes/no/neither selection. This method may take some
            arguments:

            size
              Sets the width in characters of the edit field

            format (Date properties only)
              Sets the format of the date in the field - uses the same
              format string argument as supplied to the ``pretty`` method
              below.

            popcal (Date properties only)
              Include the Javascript-based popup calendar for date
              selection. Defaults to on.

stext       only on String properties - render the value of the property
            as StructuredText (requires the StructureText module to be
            installed separately)
multiline   only on String properties - render a multiline form edit
            field for the property
email       only on String properties - render the value of the property
            as an obscured email address
url_quote   only on String properties. It quotes any characters in the
            string so it is safe to use in a url. E.G. a space is
            replaced with %20.
confirm     only on Password properties - render a second form edit field
            for the property, used for confirmation that the user typed
            the password correctly. Generates a field with name
            "name:confirm".
now         only on Date properties - return the current date as a new
            property
reldate     only on Date properties - render the interval between the date
            and now
local       only on Date properties - return this date as a new property
            with some timezone offset, for example::
            
                python:context.creation.local(10)

            will render the date with a +10 hour offset.
pretty      Date properties - render the date as "dd Mon YYYY" (eg. "19
            Mar 2004"). Takes an optional format argument, for example::

                python:context.activity.pretty('%Y-%m-%d')

            Will format as "2004-03-19" instead.

            Interval properties - render the interval in a pretty
            format (eg. "yesterday"). The format arguments are those used
            in the standard ``strftime`` call (see the `Python Library
            Reference: time module`__)

            Number properties - takes a printf style format argument
            (default: '%0.3f') and formats the number accordingly.
            If the value can't be converted, '' is returned if the
            value is ``None`` otherwise it is converted to a string.
popcal      Generate a link to a popup calendar which may be used to
            edit the date field, for example::

              <span tal:replace="structure context/due/popcal" />

            you still need to include the ``field`` for the property, so
            typically you'd have::

              <span tal:replace="structure context/due/field" />
              <span tal:replace="structure context/due/popcal" />

menu        only on Link and Multilink properties - render a form select
            list for this property. Takes a number of optional arguments

            size
               is used to limit the length of the list labels
            height
               is used to set the <select> tag's "size" attribute
            showid
               includes the item ids in the list labels
            additional
               lists properties which should be included in the label
            sort_on
                indicates the property to sort the list on as (direction,
                (direction, property) where direction is '+' or '-'. A
                single string with the direction prepended may be used.
                For example: ('-', 'order'), '+name'.
            value
                gives a default value to preselect in the menu

            The remaining keyword arguments are used as conditions for
            filtering the items in the list - they're passed as the
            "filterspec" argument to a Class.filter() call. For example::

             <span tal:replace="structure context/status/menu" />

             <span tal:replace="python:context.status.menu(order='+name",
                                   value='chatting', 
                                   filterspec={'status': '1,2,3,4'}" />

sorted      only on Multilink properties - produce a list of the linked
            items sorted by some property, for example::
            
                python:context.files.sorted('creation')

            Will list the files by upload date. While::

               python:context.files.sorted('creation', reverse=True)

            Will list the files by upload date in reverse order from
            the prior example. If the property can be unset, you can
            use the ``NoneFirst`` parameter to sort the None/Unset
            values at the front or the end of the list. For example::
            
                python:context.files.sorted('creation', NoneFirst=True)
            
            will sort files by creation date with files missing a
            creation date at the start of the list. The default for
            ``NoneFirst`` is False so these files will sort at the end
            by default. (Note creation date is never unset, but you
            get the idea.) If you combine NoneFirst with
            ``reverse=True`` the meaning of NoneFirst is inverted:
	    True sorts None/unset at the end and False sorts at the
	    beginning.
reverse     only on Multilink properties - produce a list of the linked
            items in reverse order
isset       returns True if the property has been set to a value
=========== ================================================================

__ https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html

All of the above functions perform checks for permissions required to
display or edit the data they are manipulating. The simplest case is
editing an issue title. Including the expression::

   context/title/field

Will present the user with an edit field, if they have edit permission. If
not, then they will be presented with a static display if they have view
permission. If they don't even have view permission, then an error message
is raised, preventing the display of the page, indicating that they don't
have permission to view the information.


The request variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is implemented by the ``roundup.cgi.templating.HTMLRequest``
class.

The request variable is packed with information about the current
request.

.. taken from ``roundup.cgi.templating.HTMLRequest`` docstring

=========== ============================================================

There are several methods available on the request variable:

=============== ========================================================
Method          Description
=============== ========================================================
description     render a description of the request - handle for the
                page title
indexargs_form  render the current index args as form elements
indexargs_url   render the current index args as a URL
base_javascript render some javascript that is used by other components
                of the templating
batch           run the current index args through a filter and return a
                list of items (see `hyperdb item wrapper`_, and
                `batching`_)
=============== ========================================================

The form variable
:::::::::::::::::

The form variable is a bit special because it's actually a python
FieldStorage object. That means that you have two ways to access its
contents. For example, to look up the CGI form value for the variable
"name", use the path expression::

   request/form/name/value

or the python expression::

   python:request.form['name'].value

Note the "item" access used in the python case, and also note the
explicit "value" attribute we have to access. That's because the form
variables are stored as MiniFieldStorages. If there's more than one
"name" value in the form, then the above will break since
``request/form/name`` is actually a *list* of MiniFieldStorages. So it's
best to know beforehand what you're dealing with.


The db variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is implemented by the ``roundup.cgi.templating.HTMLDatabase``
class.

Allows access to all hyperdb classes as attributes of this variable. If
you want access to the "user" class, for example, you would use::

  db/user
  python:db.user

Also, the current id of the current user is available as
``db.getuid()``. This isn't so useful in templates (where you have
``request/user``), but it can be useful in detectors or interfaces.

The access results in a `hyperdb class wrapper`_.


The templates variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This was implemented by the ``roundup.cgi.templating.Templates``
class before 1.4.20. In later versions it is the instance of appropriate
template engine loader class.

This variable is used to access other templates in expressions and
template macros. It doesn't have any useful methods defined. The
templates can be accessed using the following path expression::

   templates/name

or the python expression::

   templates[name]

where "name" is the name of the template you wish to access. The
template has one useful attribute, namely "macros". To access a specific
macro (called "macro_name"), use the path expression::

   templates/name/macros/macro_name

or the python expression::

   templates[name].macros[macro_name]

The repeat variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The repeat variable holds an entry for each active iteration. That is, if
you have a ``tal:repeat="user db/users"`` command, then there will be a
repeat variable entry called "user". This may be accessed as either::

    repeat/user
    python:repeat['user']

The "user" entry has a number of methods available for information:

=============== =========================================================
Method          Description
=============== =========================================================
first           True if the current item is the first in the sequence.
last            True if the current item is the last in the sequence.
even            True if the current item is an even item in the sequence.
odd             True if the current item is an odd item in the sequence.
number          Current position in the sequence, starting from 1.
letter          Current position in the sequence as a letter, a through
                z, then aa through zz, and so on.
Letter          Same as letter(), except uppercase.
roman           Current position in the sequence as lowercase roman
                numerals.
Roman           Same as roman(), except uppercase.
=============== =========================================================

.. _templating utilities:

The utils variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is implemented by the
``roundup.cgi.templating.TemplatingUtils`` class, which may be extended
with additional methods by extensions_.

=============== ========================================================
Method          Description
=============== ========================================================
Batch           return a batch object using the supplied list
url_quote       quote some text as safe for a URL (ie. space, %, ...)
html_quote      quote some text as safe in HTML (ie. <, >, ...)
html_calendar   renders an HTML calendar used by the
                ``_generic.calendar.html`` template (itself invoked by
                the popupCalendar DateHTMLProperty method
anti_csrf_nonce returns the random noncue generated for this session
=============== ========================================================


Batching
::::::::

Use Batch to turn a list of items, or item ids of a given class, into a
series of batches. Its usage is::

    python:utils.Batch(sequence, size, start, end=0, orphan=0,
    overlap=0)

or, to get the current index batch::

    request/batch

The parameters are:

========= ==============================================================
Parameter  Usage
========= ==============================================================
sequence  a list of HTMLItems
size      how big to make the sequence.
start     where to start (0-indexed) in the sequence.
end       where to end (0-indexed) in the sequence.
orphan    if the next batch would contain less items than this value,
          then it is combined with this batch
overlap   the number of items shared between adjacent batches
========= ==============================================================

All of the parameters are assigned as attributes on the batch object. In
addition, it has several more attributes:

=============== ========================================================
Attribute       Description
=============== ========================================================
start           indicates the start index of the batch. *Unlike
                the argument, is a 1-based index (I know, lame)*
first           indicates the start index of the batch *as a 0-based
                index*
length          the actual number of elements in the batch
sequence_length the length of the original, unbatched, sequence.

And several methods:

=============== ========================================================
Method          Description
=============== ========================================================
previous        returns a new Batch with the previous batch settings
next            returns a new Batch with the next batch settings
propchanged     detect if the named property changed on the current item
                when compared to the last item
=============== ========================================================

An example of batching::

 <table class="otherinfo">
  <tr><th colspan="4" class="header">Existing Keywords</th></tr>
  <tr tal:define="keywords db/keyword/list"
      tal:repeat="start python:range(0, len(keywords), 4)">
   <td tal:define="batch python:utils.Batch(keywords, 4, start)"
       tal:repeat="keyword batch" tal:content="keyword/name">
       keyword here</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

... which will produce a table with four columns containing the items of
the "keyword" class (well, their "name" anyway).


Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should you wish to enable multiple languages in template content that you
create you'll need to add new locale files in the tracker home under a
``locale`` directory. Use the `translation instructions in the
developer's guide <developers.html#extracting-translatable-messages>`_ to
create the locale files.


Displaying Properties
---------------------

Properties appear in the user interface in three contexts: in indices,
in editors, and as search arguments. For each type of property, there
are several display possibilities. For example, in an index view, a
string property may just be printed as a plain string, but in an editor
view, that property may be displayed in an editable field.


Index Views
-----------

This is one of the class context views. It is also the default view for
classes. The template used is "*classname*.index".


Index View Specifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An index view specifier (URL fragment) looks like this (whitespace has
been added for clarity)::

    /issue?status=unread,in-progress,resolved&
        keyword=security,ui&
        @group=priority,-status&
        @sort=-activity&
        @filters=status,keyword&
        @columns=title,status,fixer

The index view is determined by two parts of the specifier: the layout
part and the filter part. The layout part consists of the query
parameters that begin with colons, and it determines the way that the
properties of selected items are displayed. The filter part consists of
all the other query parameters, and it determines the criteria by which
items are selected for display. The filter part is interactively
manipulated with the form widgets displayed in the filter section. The
layout part is interactively manipulated by clicking on the column
headings in the table.

The filter part selects the union of the sets of items with values
matching any specified Link properties and the intersection of the sets
of items with values matching any specified Multilink properties.

The example specifies an index of "issue" items. Only items with a
"status" of either "unread" or "in-progress" or "resolved" are
displayed, and only items with "keyword" values including both "security"
and "ui" are displayed. The items are grouped by priority arranged in
ascending order and in descending order by status; and within
groups, sorted by activity, arranged in descending order. The filter
section shows filters for the "status" and "keyword" properties, and the
table includes columns for the "title", "status", and "fixer"
properties.

============ =============================================================
Argument     Description
============ =============================================================
@sort        sort by prop name, optionally preceeded with '-' to give
             descending or nothing for ascending sorting. Several
             properties can be specified delimited with comma.
             Internally a search-page using several sort properties may
             use @sort0, @sort1 etc. with option @sortdir0, @sortdir1
             etc. for the direction of sorting (a non-empty value of
             sortdir0 specifies reverse order).
@group       group by prop name, optionally preceeded with '-' or to sort
             in descending or nothing for ascending order. Several
             properties can be specified delimited with comma.
             Internally a search-page using several grouping properties may
             use @group0, @group1 etc. with option @groupdir0, @groupdir1
             etc. for the direction of grouping (a non-empty value of
             groupdir0 specifies reverse order).
@columns     selects the columns that should be displayed. Default is
             all.                     
@filter      indicates which properties are being used in filtering.
             Default is none.
propname     selects the values the item properties given by propname must
             have (very basic search/filter).
@search_text if supplied, performs a full-text search (message bodies,
             issue titles, etc)
============ =============================================================


Searching Views
---------------

.. note::
   if you add a new column to the ``@columns`` form variable potentials
   then you will need to add the column to the appropriate `index views`_
   template so that it is actually displayed.

This is one of the class context views. The template used is typically
"*classname*.search". The form on this page should have "search" as its
``@action`` variable. The "search" action:

- sets up additional filtering, as well as performing indexed text
  searching
- sets the ``@filter`` variable correctly
- saves the query off if ``@query_name`` is set.

The search page should lay out any fields that you wish to allow the
user to search on. If your schema contains a large number of properties,
you should be wary of making all of those properties available for
searching, as this can cause confusion. If the additional properties are
Strings, consider having their value indexed, and then they will be
searchable using the full text indexed search. This is both faster, and
more useful for the end user.

If the search view does specify the "search" ``@action``, then it may also
provide an additional argument:

============ =============================================================
Argument     Description
============ =============================================================
@query_name  if supplied, the index parameters (including @search_text)
             will be saved off as a the query item and registered against
             the user's queries property. Note that the *classic* template
             schema has this ability, but the *minimal* template schema
             does not.
============ =============================================================


Item Views
----------

The basic view of a hyperdb item is provided by the "*classname*.item"
template. It generally has three sections; an "editor", a "spool" and a
"history" section.


Editor Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The editor section is used to manipulate the item - it may be a static
display if the user doesn't have permission to edit the item.

Here's an example of a basic editor template (this is the default
"classic" template issue item edit form - from the "issue.item.html"
template)::

 <table class="form">
 <tr>
  <th>Title</th>
  <td colspan="3" tal:content="structure python:context.title.field(size=60)">title</td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
  <th>Priority</th>
  <td tal:content="structure context/priority/menu">priority</td>
  <th>Status</th>
  <td tal:content="structure context/status/menu">status</td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
  <th>Superseder</th>
  <td>
   <span tal:replace="structure python:context.superseder.field(showid=1, size=20)" />
   <span tal:replace="structure python:db.issue.classhelp('id,title')" />
   <span tal:condition="context/superseder">
    <br>View: <span tal:replace="structure python:context.superseder.link(showid=1)" />
   </span>
  </td>
  <th>Nosy List</th>
  <td>
   <span tal:replace="structure context/nosy/field" />
   <span tal:replace="structure python:db.user.classhelp('username,realname,address,phone')" />
  </td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
  <th>Assigned To</th>
  <td tal:content="structure context/assignedto/menu">
   assignedto menu
  </td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
  <th>Change Note</th>
  <td colspan="3">
   <textarea name=":note" wrap="hard" rows="5" cols="60"></textarea>
  </td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
  <th>File</th>
  <td colspan="3"><input type="file" name=":file" size="40"></td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td colspan="3" tal:content="structure context/submit">
   submit button will go here
  </td>
 </tr>
 </table>


When a change is submitted, the system automatically generates a message
describing the changed properties. As shown in the example, the editor
template can use the ":note" and ":file" fields, which are added to the
standard changenote message generated by Roundup.


Form values
:::::::::::

We have a number of ways to pull properties out of the form in order to
meet the various needs of:

1. editing the current item (perhaps an issue item)
2. editing information related to the current item (eg. messages or
   attached files)
3. creating new information to be linked to the current item (eg. time
   spent on an issue)

In the following, ``<bracketed>`` values are variable, ":" may be one of
":" or "@", and other text ("required") is fixed.

Properties are specified as form variables:

``<propname>``
  property on the current context item

``<designator>:<propname>``
  property on the indicated item (for editing related information)

``<classname>-<N>:<propname>``
  property on the Nth new item of classname (generally for creating new
  items to attach to the current item)

Once we have determined the "propname", we check to see if it is one of
the special form values:

``@required``
  The named property values must be supplied or a ValueError will be
  raised.

``@remove@<propname>=id(s)``
  The ids will be removed from the multilink property.

``:add:<propname>=id(s)``
  The ids will be added to the multilink property.

``:link:<propname>=<designator>``
  Used to add a link to new items created during edit. These are
  collected and returned in ``all_links``. This will result in an
  additional linking operation (either Link set or Multilink append)
  after the edit/create is done using ``all_props`` in ``_editnodes``.
  The <propname> on the current item will be set/appended the id of the
  newly created item of class <designator> (where <designator> must be
  <classname>-<N>).

Any of the form variables may be prefixed with a classname or
designator.

Two special form values are supported for backwards compatibility:

``:note``
  create a message (with content, author and date), linked to the
  context item. This is ALWAYS designated "msg-1".
``:file``
  create a file, attached to the current item and any message created by
  :note. This is ALWAYS designated "file-1".


Spool Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The spool section lists related information like the messages and files
of an issue.

TODO


History Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final section displayed is the history of the item - its database
journal. This is generally generated with the template::

 <tal:block tal:replace="structure context/history" />

or::

   <tal:block
       tal:replace="structure python:context.history(showall=True)" />

if you want to show history entries for quiet properties.

*To be done:*

*The actual history entries of the item may be accessed for manual
templating through the "journal" method of the item*::

 <tal:block tal:repeat="entry context/journal">
  a journal entry
 </tal:block>

*where each journal entry is an HTMLJournalEntry.*


Defining new web actions
------------------------

You may define new actions to be triggered by the ``@action`` form variable.
These are added to the tracker ``extensions`` directory and registered
using ``instance.registerAction``.

All the existing Actions are defined in ``roundup.cgi.actions``.

Adding action classes takes three steps; first you `define the new
action class`_, then you `register the action class`_ with the cgi
interface so it may be triggered by the ``@action`` form variable.
Finally you `use the new action`_ in your HTML form.

See `setting up a "wizard" (or "druid") for controlled adding of
issues
<customizing.html#setting-up-a-wizard-or-druid-for-controlled-adding-of-issues>`_ for an example.


Define the new action class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new action class in your tracker's ``extensions`` directory, for
example ``myaction.py``::

 from roundup.cgi.actions import Action

 class MyAction(Action):
     def handle(self):
         ''' Perform some action. No return value is required.
         '''

The *self.client* attribute is an instance of ``roundup.cgi.client.Client``.
See the docstring of that class for details of what it can do.

The method will typically check the ``self.form`` variable's contents.
It may then:

- add information to ``self.client._ok_message``
  or ``self.client._error_message`` (by using ``self.client.add_ok_message``
  or ``self.client.add_error_message``, respectively)
- change the ``self.client.template`` variable to alter what the user will see
  next
- raise Unauthorised, SendStaticFile, SendFile, NotFound or Redirect
  exceptions (import them from roundup.cgi.exceptions)


Register the action class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The class is now written, but isn't available to the user until you register
it with the following code appended to your ``myaction.py`` file::

    def init(instance):
        instance.registerAction('myaction', myActionClass)

This maps the action name "myaction" to the action class we defined.


Use the new action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your HTML form, add a hidden form element like so::

  <input type="hidden" name="@action" value="myaction">

where "myaction" is the name you registered in the previous step.

Actions may return content to the user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Actions generally perform some database manipulation and then pass control
on to the rendering of a template in the current context (see `Determining
web context`_ for how that works.) Some actions will want to generate the
actual content returned to the user. Action methods may return their own
content string to be displayed to the user, overriding the templating step.
In this situation, we assume that the content is HTML by default. You may
override the content type indicated to the user by calling ``setHeader``::

   self.client.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/csv')

This example indicates that the value sent back to the user is actually
comma-separated value content (eg. something to be loaded into a
spreadsheet or database).


8-bit character set support in Web interface
--------------------------------------------

The web interface uses UTF-8 default. It may be overridden in both forms
and a browser cookie.

- In forms, use the ``@charset`` variable.
- To use the cookie override, have the ``roundup_charset`` cookie set.

In both cases, the value is a valid charset name (eg. ``utf-8`` or
``kio8-r``).

Inside Roundup, all strings are stored and processed in utf-8.
Unfortunately, some older browsers do not work properly with
utf-8-encoded pages (e.g. Netscape Navigator 4 displays wrong
characters in form fields).  This version allows one to change
the character set for http transfers.  To do so, you may add
the following code to your ``page.html`` template::

 <tal:block define="uri string:${request/base}${request/env/PATH_INFO}">
  <a tal:attributes="href python:request.indexargs_url(uri,
   {'@charset':'utf-8'})">utf-8</a>
  <a tal:attributes="href python:request.indexargs_url(uri,
   {'@charset':'koi8-r'})">koi8-r</a>
 </tal:block>

(substitute ``koi8-r`` with appropriate charset for your language).
Charset preference is kept in the browser cookie ``roundup_charset``.

``meta http-equiv`` lines added to the tracker templates in version 0.6.0
should be changed to include actual character set name::

 <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
  tal:attributes="content string:text/html;; charset=${request/client/charset}"
 />

The charset is also sent in the http header.





Debugging Trackers
==================

There are three switches in tracker configs that turn on debugging in
Roundup:

1. web :: debug
2. mail :: debug
3. logging :: level

See the config.ini file or the `tracker configuration`_ section for
more information.

Additionally, the ``roundup-server.py`` script has its own debugging mode
in which it reloads edited templates immediately when they are changed,
rather than requiring a web server restart.
