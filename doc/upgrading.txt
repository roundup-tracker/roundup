        Critical documentation for upgrading the Roundup Issue
        Tracker. Actions that must be taken when upgrading from
        one version to another are documented here.

.. index:: Upgrading

======================================
Upgrading to newer versions of Roundup
======================================

Please read each section carefully and edit the files in your tracker home
accordingly. Note that there is information about upgrade procedures in the
`administration guide`_ in the `Software Upgrade`_ section.

If a specific version transition isn't mentioned here (e.g. 0.6.7 to
0.6.8) then you don't need to do anything.  If you're upgrading from
0.5.6 to 0.6.8 though, you'll need to apply the "0.5 to 0.6" and
"0.6.x to 0.6.3" steps.

General steps:

   1. Make note of your current Roundup version.
   2. Take your Roundup installation offline (web, email,
      cron scripts, roundup-admin etc.)
   3. Backup your Roundup instance
   4. Install the new version of Roundup (preferably in a new virtual
      environment)
   5. Make version specific changes as described below for
      each version transition. If you are starting at 1.5.0
      and installing to 2.3.0, you need to make the changes for **all**
      versions starting at 1.5 and ending at 2.3. E.G.
      1.5.0 -> 1.5.1, 1.5.1 -> 1.6.0, ..., 2.1.0 -> 2.2.0,
      2.2.0 -> 2.3.0.
   6. Run ``roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> migrate`` using the newer
      version of Roundup for **all** the trackers you have
      upgraded. This will update the database if it is required.
   7. Bring your Roundup instance back online
   8. Test

.. note::
   The v1.5.x releases of Roundup were the last to support
   Python v2.5 and v2.6.  Starting with the v1.6 releases of Roundup
   Python version 2.7 that is newer than 2.7.2 is required to run
   Roundup.  Starting with Roundup version 2.0.0 we also support Python 3
   versions newer than 3.6.

Recent release notes have the following labels:

* required - Roundup will not work properly if these steps are not done
* recommended - Roundup will still work, but these steps can cause
  security or stability issues if not done.
* optional - new features or changes to existing features you might
  want to use
* info - important possibly visible changes in how things operate

If you use virtual environments for your installation, you can run
trackers with different versions of Roundup. So you can have one tracker
using version 2.2.0 and another tracker using version 1.6.1. This
allows you to upgrade trackers one at a time rather than having to
upgrade all your trackers at once.

.. note::

   This file only includes versions released in the last 10
   years. If you are upgrading from an older version, start with the
   changes in the `historical migration <upgrading-history.html>`_
   document.

.. admonition:: Python 2 Support

  If you are running Roundup under Python 2, you should make plans to
  switch to Python 3. Release 2.5.0 (expected release Jul 2025)
  will be the last release to support Python 2. The continuous
  Integration (CI) and other services
  used for developing Roundup are dropping support for Python 2. Also
  optional packages are dropping Python 2 support.

.. admonition:: XHTML Support Deprecation Notice

  If you are running a tracker where the ``html_version`` setting in
  ``config.ini`` is ``xhtml``, you should plan to change your
  templates to use html (HTML5). If you are affected by this, please
  send email to the roundup-users mailing list (roundup-users at
  lists.sourceforge.net). Version 2.3.0 is expected to be the last
  version to support XHTML.

.. index:: Upgrading; 2.2.0 to 2.3.0

Migrating from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0
=============================

Update your ``config.ini`` (required)
-------------------------------------

Upgrade tracker's config.ini file. Use::

  roundup-admin -i /path/to/tracker updateconfig newconfig.ini

to generate a new ini file preserving all your settings.
You can then merge any local comments from the tracker's
``config.ini`` to ``newconfig.ini`` and replace
``config.ini`` with ``newconfig.ini``.

``updateconfig`` will tell you if it is changing old default
values or if a value must be changed manually.

This will insert the bad API login rate limiting settings.

Also if you have ``html_version`` set to ``xhtml``, you will get
an error.

Use of xhtml html_version disabled (required)
---------------------------------------------

If you enabled xhtml formatted templates, you will need to
change them to html (html4) format. Also change the value of
``html_version`` from ``xhtml`` to ``html``.

Note that the default Roundup templates use html4 so it is
unlikely that your templates are xhtml based. See
`issue2551323
<https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2551323>`_ for
details on the deprecation of xhtml.

Update MySQL character set/collations (required)
------------------------------------------------

issue2551282_ and issue2551115_ discuss issues with MySQL's utf8
support. MySQL has variations on utf8 character support. This
version of Roundup expects to use utf8mb4 which is a version of
utf8 that covers all characters, not just the ones in the basic
multilingual plane. Previous versions of Roundup used latin1 or
utf8mb3 (also known as just utf8). Newer versions of MySQL are
supposed to make utf8mb4 and not utf8mb3 the default.

To convert your database, you need to have MySQL 8.0.11 or newer
(April 2018) and a mysql client.

.. warning::

   This conversion can damage your database. Back up your
   database using mysqldump or other tools. Preferably on a quiet
   database.  Verify that your database can be restored (or at
   least look up directions for restoring it). This is very
   important.

We suggest shutting down Roundup's interfaces:

  * web
  * email
  * cron jobs that use Python or roundup-admin

then make your backup.

Then connect to your mysql instance using ``mysql`` with the
information in ``config.ini``. If your tracker's ``config.ini``
includes::

  name = roundupdb
  host = localhost
  user = roundupuser
  password = rounduppw

you would run some version of::

  mysql -u roundupuser --host localhost -p roundupdb

and supply ``rounduppw`` when prompted.

With the Roundup database quiet, convert the character set for the
database and then for all the tables. To convert the tables you
need a list of them. To get this run::

    mysql -sN -u roundupuser --host localhost -p \
       -e 'show tables;' roundupdb > /tmp/tracker.tables

The ``-sN`` removes line drawing characters and column headers
from the output. For each table ``<t>`` in the file, run::

 ALTER TABLE `<t>` CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

You can automate this conversion using sed::

    sed -e 's/^/ALTER TABLE `/' \
     -e 's/$/` CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;/'\
     /tmp/tracker.tables> /tmp/tracker.tables.sql

The backticks "`" are required as some of the table names became
MySQL reserved words during Roundup's lifetime.

Inspect ``tracker.tables.sql`` to see if all the lines look
correct. If so then we can start the conversion.

First convert the character set for the database by running::

  mysql -u roundupuser --host localhost -p roundupdb

Then at the ``mysql>`` prompt run::

  ALTER DATABASE roundupdb CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

you should see: ``Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)``.

Now to modify all the tables run:

  \. /tmp/tracker.tables.sql

You will see output similar to::

  Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.01 sec)
  Records: 5  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

for each table. The rows/records will depend on the number of
entries in the table. This can take a while.

Once you have successfully completed this, copy your tracker's
config.ini to a backup file. Edit ``config.ini`` to use the defaults:

 * mysql_charset = utf8mb4
 * mysql_collation = utf8mb4_unicode_ci
 * mysql_binary_collation = utf8mb4_0900_bin

Also look for a ``~/.my.cnf`` for the roundup user and make sure
that the settings for character set (charset) are utf8mb4 compatible.

To test, run ``roundup-admin -i tracker_home`` and display an
issue designator: e.g. ``display issue10``. Check that the text
fields are properly displayed (e.g. title). Start the web
interface and browse some issues. Again, check that the text
fields display correctly, that the history at the bottom of the
issues displays correctly and if you are using the default full
text search, make sure that that works.

If this works, bring email cron jobs etc. back online.

If this fails, take down the web interface, restore the database
from backup, restore the old config.ini. Then test again and
reach out to the mailing list for help.

We can use assistance in getting these directions corrected or
enhanced. The core Roundup developers don't use MySQL for their
production workloads so we count on users to help us with this.

.. _issue2551115: https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2551115

Add new classhelper to your templates (optional)
------------------------------------------------

The classic classhelper invoked by the ``(list)`` link in your
issue.item.html template can be greatly improved by wrapping the
links with the new web-component based ``roundup-classhelper``.

The new classhelper:

  * allows you to select items from multiple pages
  * is usable with a content security policy
  * is more easily styled
  
To deploy it, install the required files and wrap classhelp calls
in the new ``<roundup-classhelper>`` component. For example,
wrap::

  <span tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok" tal:replace="structure
     python:db.user.classhelp('username,realname,address',
     property='nosy', width='600'" />

so it looks like::

    <roundup-classhelper
      data-search-with="username,phone,roles[]">

      <span tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok" tal:replace="structure
         python:db.user.classhelp('username,realname,address',
         property='nosy', width='600')" />

    </roundup-classhelper>

to allow the user to search by: username, phone number and use a
select/dropdown to search by role. Full details about the
attributes and installation instructions can be found in the
`classhelper documentation`_ in the admin guide.


Disable performance improvement for wsgi mode (optional)
--------------------------------------------------------

In Roundup version 2.2.0, an experimental feature was introduced to
enhance performance while operating in wsgi mode. Initially, this
feature was disabled. Over the past two years, it has been used at a
few sites without any reported problems.

As a result, the default setting now enables this performance
improvement, encouraging a wider adoption of the feature. In the
event that an undiscovered bug arises, it can still be disabled
if you experience problems. To disable it, modify your wsgi
startup script and add the feature_flags to the RequestDispatcher
as below:

   feature_flags = { "cache_tracker": False }
   app =  RequestDispatcher(tracker_home, feature_flags=feature_flags)

Then restart your wsgi instance. If you have to disable this
feature, send email to the roundup-users mailing list
(roundup-users at lists.sourceforge.net) so we can help you
diagnose the cause and fix it for everybody.

In the future, support for disabling this improvement will be removed.

Fix duplicate id for confirm password in user.item.html (optional)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The TAL macro ``user_confirm_input`` at the end of ``html/page.html``
for all templates except ``jinja2`` sets the ``id`` of the ``Confirm
password`` input the same as the ``Login Password`` input. This
creates an HTML error. Two items must not have the same id.

However browsers ignore the error and things still work.  If you were
to use css or javascript to target the ``password`` id, it would not
work as expected.

To fix this, change the line near the end of your tracker's
``html/page.html`` from::

 tal:attributes="id name; name string:@confirm@$name; readonly not:edit_ok" value="">

to::

 tal:attributes="id string:confirm_$name; name string:@confirm@$name; readonly not:edit_ok" value="">

This will change the id to ``confirm_password``.

Merge changes from devel template task.index.html (optional)
------------------------------------------------------------

The devel template's ``task.index.html`` has some fields that are not
defined in the schema. It looks like it was originally copied from the
``bug.index.html``. If the task index is requested without specifying
the columns/fields, the template will crash trying to display
``severity`` and other fields that don't exist in the task schema.

In normal use, the left hand menu for tasks always specifies valid
columns so you may not see this issue. However if you remove the
``@columns`` query parameter, you can see the error.

The removed columns are: severity, versions, keywords, dependencies.

It is also missing the ``solves`` field which is added to match the
schema.

`You can see the diff in the Sourceforge web interface <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/54eb12cd3be143b079809795dcb2f813f75a691c/tree/share/roundup/templates/devel/html/task.index.html?diff=c95870b2bbab822def6066498a4ef8634e76e0b3>`_.

Make group headers span all columns (optional)
----------------------------------------------

In a number of index pages a version of the following TAL command
appears::

  <th tal:attributes="colspan python:len(request.columns)" class="group">

If the ``@columns`` parameter (aka request.columns) is not set,
all columns are shown. However the group header only spans the
first column. Changing this to read::

  <th tal:attributes="colspan python:len(request.columns) or 100" class="group">

makes the group header span all the columns (if you have fewer
than 100 columns). All of the supplied templates hae been
upgraded with this change. `See issue 2551341 for details
<https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2551341>`_.

Note the jinja2 template has the same issue, but the development
team hasn't devised a solution.

Use @current_user in Searches (optional)
----------------------------------------

You can create queries like: "My issues" by searching the ``creator``
property of issues for your id number. Similarly you can search for
"Issues assigned to me" by searching on the ``assignedto`` property.

Queries in Roundup can be shared between users. However queries like
these can be shared. However for any user but they will only find
issues created by/assigned to the user who created the query.

This release allows you to search Links to the User class by
specifying ``@current_user``. This token searches for the currently
log in user. It makes searches like the above usable when shared.

This only works for properties that are a Link to the user
class. E.G. creator, actor, assignedto. It does not yet work for
MultiLink properties (like nosy).

As an example this can be deployed to the classic tracker's issue
search template (issue.search.html), by replacing::

    <option metal:fill-slot="extra_options" i18n:translate=""
            tal:attributes="value request/user/id">created by
            me</option>

with::

    <option metal:fill-slot="extra_options" value="@current_user"
            tal:attributes="selected python:value == '@current_user'"
            i18n:translate="">created by me</option>

There are three places where ``value request/user/id`` is used in the
classic template. Your template may have more.

If you have a user with the exact username of `@current_user` they
should change it. `Details can be found in issue1525113
<https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue1525113>`_.

New PostgreSQL Settings (optional)
----------------------------------

With this release, you can specify a Postgresql database schema
to use. By default Roundup creates a database when using
``roundup-admin init``. Setting the rdbms ``name`` keyword to
``roundup_database.roundup_schema`` will create and use the
``roundup_schema`` in the pre-created ``roundup_database``. See
the `Roundup PostgreSQL documentation`_ for details on how to set
up the roles.

Also there is a new configuration keyword in the rdbms
section of ``config.ini``. The ``service`` keyword allows
you to define the service name for Postgres that will be
looked up in the `Connection Service File`_. Any of the
methods of specifying the file including by using the
``PGSERVICEFILE`` environment variable are supported.

This is similar to the existing support for MySQL
option/config files and groups.

If you use services, any settings for the same properties
(user, name, password ...) that are in the tracker's
``config.ini`` will override the service settings. So you
want to leave the ``config.ini`` settings blank. E.G.::

  [rdbms]
  name =
  host =
  port =
  user =
  password =
  service = roundup_roundup

Setting ``service`` to ``roundup_roundup`` with
the following in the service file::

   [roundup_roundup]
   host=127.0.0.1
   port=5432
   user=roundup
   password=roundup
   dbname=roundup

would use the roundup database with the specified
credentials. It is possible to define a service that
connects to a specific schema using::

  options=-c search_path=roundup_service_dev

Note that the first schema specified after ``search_path=``
is created and populated. The schema name
(``roundup_service_dev``) must be terminated by: a comma,
whitespace or end of line.

You can use the command ``psql "service=db_service_name"``
to verify the settings in the connection file. Inside of
``psql`` you can verify the ``search_path`` using ``show
search_path;``.

.. _`Connection Service File`: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgservice.html

Update for user.help-search.html (optional)
-------------------------------------------

There is a bug in the template used as a search helper for the user
fields (e.g. the nosy list). The ``properties`` url query argument was
ignored. You can not select the displayed fields using the
``properties`` argument. This is fixed in 2.4.0. You can probably just
copy the ``user.help-search.html`` from the classic tracker template.

If you have modified that template, you can follow the analysis in
`issue2551320 <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2551320>`_
to fix your template.

Update for _generic.help.html (optional)
----------------------------------------

Using the ``_generic.help.html`` template with ``classhelper()`` to
provide information on a property without selecting a property caused
an error when processing the template. Using the help template with
Link properties can provide description or other information that the
user can use to determine the right setting.

If your tracker is based on the minimal or classic tracker and you have
not changed the _generic.help.html file, you can copy it into place
from the template directory.


Fix static_files use of '-' directory (info)
--------------------------------------------

Use of the '-' directory in ``static_files`` config.ini setting now
works. So it will prevent access to the html directory when using
``@@file/`` based url's.


Bad Login Rate Limiting and Locking (info)
------------------------------------------

Brute force logins have been rate limited in the HTML web interface
for a while. This was not the case with the API interfaces.

This release introduces rate limiting for invalid REST or XMLRPC API
logins.  As with the web interface, users who have hit the rate limit
have their accounts locked until after the recommended delay time has
passed.  See `information on configuring the API rate limits`_ for
details.

.. _`information on configuring the API rate limits`: rest.html#rate-limiting-api-failed-logins

Removal of cgi.py from Python (info)
------------------------------------

The ``cgi.py`` module will be `removed starting with Python 3.13
<https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/#cgi>`_. Roundup now `vendors a copy
<https://pypi.org/project/legacy-cgi/>`_ of ``cgi.py`` and makes it
and its storage objects available by importing from::

   from roundup.anypy.cgi_ import cgi
   from roundup.anypy.cgi_ import FieldStorage, MiniFieldStorage

It is unlikely that you will care unless you have done some expert
level Roundup customization. If you have, use one of the imports above
if you plan on running on Python 3.13 (expected in 2024) or newer.

Fixing PostgreSQL Out of Memory Errors when Importing Tracker (info)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Importing a tracker into PostgreSQL can run out of memory with the
error::

   psycopg2.errors.OutOfMemory: out of shared memory
   HINT:  You might need to increase max_locks_per_transaction.

before changing your PostgreSQL configuration, try changing the pragma
``savepoint_limit`` to a lower value. By default it is set to
``10000``. In some cases this may be too high. See the `administration
guide`_ for further details.

roundup-admin's History Command Produces Readable Output (info)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The history command of roundup-admin used to print the raw journal
data. In this release the default is to produce more human readable
data. The original output (not pretty printed as below) was::

  [('1', <Date 2013-02-18.20:30:34.125>, '1', 'create', {}),
  ('1',
   <Date 2013-02-19.21:24:20.391>,
   '1',
   'set',
   {'messages': (('+', ['3']),)}),
  ('1', <Date 2013-02-19.21:24:24.797>, '1', 'set', {'priority': '1'}),
  ('1',
   <Date 2013-02-20.03:16:52.000>,
   '1',
   'link',
   ('issue', '2', 'dependson')),
  ('1', <Date 2013-02-21.20:51:40.750>, '1', 'link', ('issue', '2',
  'seealso')),
  ('1',
   <Date 2013-02-22.05:33:08.875>,
   '1',
   'set',
   {'dependson': (('+', ['3']),), 'private': None, 'queue': None}),
  ('1',
   <Date 2013-02-22.05:33:19.406>,
   '1',
   'set',
   {'dependson': (('+', ['2']),)}),
  ('1',
   <Date 2013-02-27.03:24:42.844>,
   '1',
   'unlink',
   ('issue', '2', 'seealso')),
   ...

Now it produces (Each entry is on one line, lines wrapped
and indented for display)::

  admin(2013-02-18.20:30:34) create issue
  admin(2013-02-19.21:24:20) set modified messages: added: msg3
  admin(2013-02-19.21:24:24) set priority was critical(1)
  admin(2013-02-20.03:16:52) link added issue2 to dependson
  admin(2013-02-21.20:51:40) link added issue2 to seealso
  admin(2013-02-22.05:33:08) set modified dependson: added: issue3;
       private was None; queue was None
  admin(2013-02-22.05:33:19) set modified dependson: added: issue2
  admin(2013-02-27.03:24:42) unlink removed issue2 from seealso
  ...


A few things to note: set operations can either assign a property or
report a modification of a multilink property. If an assignment
occurs, the value reported is the **old value** that was there before
the assignment. It is **not** the value that is assigned. In the
example above I don't know what the current value of priority is. All
I know it was set to critical when the issue was created.

Modifications to multilink properties work differently. I know that
``msg3`` was present in the messages property after 2013-02-19 at
21:24:20 UTC.

The history command gets a new optional argument ``raw`` that produces
the old style output. The old style is (marginally) more useful for
script automation.

Deprecation Notices (info)
--------------------------

Support for SQLite version 1 has been removed in 2.4.0.

Support for StructuredText has been removed in 2.4.0. Support for
reStructuredText remains.

Support for the `PySQLite <https://github.com/ghaering/pysqlite>`_
library will be removed in 2.5.0. Only the Python supplied sqlite3
library will be supported.

.. index:: Upgrading; 2.2.0 to 2.3.0

Migrating from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0
=============================

Update your ``config.ini`` (required)
-------------------------------------

Upgrade tracker's config.ini file. Use::

  roundup-admin -i /path/to/tracker updateconfig newconfig.ini

to generate a new ini file preserving all your settings.
You can then merge any local comments from the tracker's
``config.ini`` to ``newconfig.ini`` and replace
``config.ini`` with ``newconfig.ini``.

``updateconfig`` will tell you if it is changing old default
values or if a value must be changed manually.

Using the roundup-mailgw script (required)
------------------------------------------

In previous versions the roundup-mailgw script had a ``-C`` (or
``--class``) option for specifying a class to be used with ``-S`` (or
``--set``) option(s). In the latest version the ``-C`` option is gone,
the class for this option is specified as a prefix, e.g. instead of ::

    roundup-mailgw -C issue -S issueprop=value

You now specify ::

    roundup-mailgw -S issue.issueprop=value

If multiple values need to be set, this can be achieved with multiple
``-S`` options or with delimiting multiple values with a semicolon (in
that case the string needs to be quoted because semicolon is a shell
special character)::

    roundup-mailgw -S 'issue.issueprop1=value1;issueprop2=value2'
    roundup-mailgw -S issue.issueprop1=value1 -S issue.issueprop2=value2

are equivalent.  Note that the class is provided as a prefix for the
set-string, not for each property. The class can be omitted altogether
in which case it defaults to ``msg`` (this default existed in previous
versions).

If you do not use the ``-C`` (or ``--class``) option in your current
setup of mailgw you don't need to change anything.

Replace Create User permission for Anonymous with Register (required)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Check your trackers schema.py. If you have the following code::

    db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', 'Create', 'user')

after the permission for Anonymous 'Email Access', change it to::

    db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', 'Register', 'user')

The comment for Anonymous 'Email Access' may refer to Create. Change
it to refer to Register.

This will be an issue if you used the devel or responsive tracker
templates. If you used a classic, minimal or jinja2 template the
permission change (but not the comment change) should be done already.

Rdbms version change from 7 to 8 (required)
-------------------------------------------

This release includes a change that requires updates to the
database schema.

Sessions and one time key (otks) tables in the Mysql and
PostgreSQL database use a numeric type that
truncates/rounds expiration timestamps. This results in
entries being purged early or late (depending on whether
it rounds up or down). The discrepancy is a couple of
days for Mysql or a couple of minutes for PostgreSQL.

Session keys stay for a week or more and CSRF keys are
two weeks by default. As a result, this isn't usually a
visible issue. This migration updates the numeric types
to ones that supports more significant figures.

You should backup your instance and run the
``roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> migrate``
command for all your trackers once you've
installed the latest code base.

Do this before you use the web, command-line or mail
interface and before any users access the tracker.

If successful, this command will respond with either
"Tracker updated" (if you've not previously run it on an
RDBMS backend) or "No migration action required" (if you
have run it, or have used another interface to the tracker,
or are using anydbm).

Session/OTK data storage for SQLite backend changed (required)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Roundup stores a lot of ephemeral data:

* login session tokens,
* rate limits
* password reset attempt tokens
* one time keys
* and anti CSRF keys.

These were stored using dbm style files while the main data
is stored in a SQLite db. Using both dbm and sqlite style
files is surprising and due to how we lock dbm files can be
a performance issue.

However you can continue to use the dbm files by setting the
``backend`` option in the ``[sessiondb]`` section of
``config.ini`` to ``anydbm``.

If you do not change the setting, two sqlite databases
called ``db-otk`` and ``db-session`` replace the dbm
databases. Once you make the change the old ``otks`` and
``sessions`` dbm databases can be removed.

Note this replacement will require users to log in again and
refresh web pages to save data. It is best if people save
all their changes and log out of Roundup before the upgrade
is done to minimize confusion. Because the data is
ephemeral, there is no plan to migrate this data to the new
SQLite databases. If you want to keep using the data set the
``sessiondb`` ``backend`` option as described above.

Update ``config.ini``'s ``password_pbkdf2_default_rounds`` (required)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Roundup hashes passwords using PBKDF2 with SHA1. In this release, you
can `upgrade to PBKDF2-SHA512 from current PBKDF2-SHA1 (recommended)`_.  If you
upgrade, you want to set the default rounds according to the
PBKDF2-SHA512 upgrading directions. Note that this algorithm is
expected to be the default in a future version of Roundup.

If you don't want to upgrade, we recommend that you increase the
default number of rounds from the original 10000. PBKDF2 has a
parameter that makes hashing a password more difficult to do.  The
original 10000 value was set years ago. It has not been updated for
advancements in computing power.

This release of Roundup changes the value to 2000000 (2
million). This exceeds the current `recommended setting of
1,300,000`_ for PBKDF2 when used with SHA1.

.. caution::

  If you were using the old 10000 value, **it will be automatically
  upgraded** to 2 million by using ``roundup-admin``'s
  ``updateconfig``.  If you were not using the old 10000 default, you
  should update it manually.

After the change users will still be able to log in using the older
10000 round hashed passwords. If ``migrate_passwords`` is set to
``yes``, passwords will be automatically re-hashed using the new
higher value when the user logs in. If
``password_pbkdf2_default_rounds`` is set to a lower value than was
used to hash a password, the password will not be rehashed so the
higher value will be kept. The lower value will be used only if the
password is changed using the web or command line.

Increasing the number of rounds will slow down re-hashing. That's the
whole point.  Sadly it will also slow down logins.  Usually the hash
takes under 1 second, but if you are using a slow chip (e.g. an ARM V6
at 700 bogo mips) it can take 30 seconds to compute the 2000000
rounds. The slowdown is linear. So what takes .001 seconds at 10000
rounds will take: ``2000000/10000 * .001 = 200 * .001`` seconds or 0.2
seconds.

You can see how long it will take by using the new ``roundup-admin``
``perftest`` command. After you have finished migrating your database,
run::

  roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> perftest password scheme=PBKDF2 rounds=10000

and then::

  roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> perftest password scheme=PBKDF2 rounds=2,000,000

so see the difference. Output from this command looks like::

   Hash time: 0.203151849s scheme: PBKDF2 rounds: 10000

If your testing reports a hash time above 0.5 seconds for 10000
rounds, there may be another issue. See if executing::

  python3 -c 'from hashlib import pbkdf2_hmac'

produces an error.

If you get an ImportError, you are using Roundup's fallback PBKDF2
implementation. It is much slower than the library version.  As a
result re-encrypting the password (and logging in, which requires
calculating the encrypted password) will be very slow.

You should find out how to make the import succeed. You may need to
install an OS vendor package or some other library.

.. _recommended setting of 1,300,000: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2

Upgrade to PBKDF2-SHA512 from current PBKDF2-SHA1 (recommended)
---------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend that you upgrade to using PBKDF2-SHA512 for hashing your
passwords. This is a more secure method than the old PBKDF2 (with
SHA1). Because the algorithm is more secure, it uses a smaller value
for ``password_pbkdf2_default_rounds``. Setting
``password_pbkdf2_default_rounds`` to ``250000`` exceeds the current
`recommended setting of 210,000`_ iterations for PBKDF2 when used with
SHA512.

You can see how long this takes to calculate on your hardware using
``roundup-admin``'s perftest command. For example::

  roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> perftest password scheme=PBKDF2S5 rounds=250,000

produces::

  Hash time: 0.161892945 seconds, scheme: PBKDF2S5, rounds: 250000

Any increase in the number of rounds will cause the password to
automatically be rehashed to the higher value the next time the user
logs in via the web interface. Changing the number of rounds to a
**lower** value will not trigger a rehash during login unless the
scheme is also being changed. The lower number will be used only when
the password is explicitly changed using the web interface or the
command line (``roundup-admin`` for example).

Change the default hashing scheme by adding the following lines to
|the interfaces.py file|_ in your tracker home::

  from roundup.password import Password
  ## Use PBDKF2S5 (PBKDF2-SHA512) for passwords. Re-hash old PBDFK2
  # Force password with scheme PBKDF2 (SHA1) to get re-hashed
  Password.deprecated_schemes.insert(0, Password.known_schemes[0])
  # choose PBKDF2S5 as the scheme to use for rehashing.
  Password.default_scheme = Password.experimental_schemes[0]

You may need to create the ``interfaces.py`` file if it doesn't exist.
In the future, when the default hash is changed to PBKDF2S5, upgrade
directions will include instructions to remove these lines and
the file ``interfaces.py`` if it becomes empty.

You can verify that PBKDF2S5 is used by default by running::

  roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> perftest password rounds=250,000

and verify that the scheme is PBKDF2S5.

jQuery updated with updates to user.help.html (recommended)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The devel and responsive templates shipped with an old version of
jQuery. According to automated tests, it may have a security issue. It
has been updated to the current version: 3.6.3. If your tracker is
based on one of these templates (see the ``TEMPLATE-INFO.txt`` file in
your tracker), remove the old ``html/jquery.js`` file from your
tracker and copy the new ``jquery-3.6.3.js`` file from the template
directory to your tracker's ``html`` directory. Also copy in the new
``user.help.html`` file. It now references the new ``jquery-3.6.3.js``
file.


Session/OTK data storage using Redis (optional)
-----------------------------------------------

You can store your ephemeral data in a Redis database. This
provides significantly better performance for ephemeral data
than SQLite or dbm files. See the section `Using Redis for
Session Databases`_ in the `administration guide`_


.. _Using Redis for Session Databases:
    admin_guide.html#using-redis-for-session-databases

New SQLite databases created with WAL mode journaling (optional)
----------------------------------------------------------------

By default, SQLite databases use a rollback journal when
writing an update. The rollback journal stores a copy of the
data from before the update. One downside of this is that
all reads have to be suspended while a write is
occurring. SQLite has an alternate way of insuring ACID
compliance by using a WAL (write ahead log) journal.

Version 2.3.0 of Roundup, creates new SQLite databases using
WAL journaling. With WAL, a writer does not block readers
and readers do not block writing an update. This keeps
Roundup accessible even under a heavy write load (e.g. when
bulk loading data or automated updates via REST).

If you want to convert your existing SQLite db to WAL mode:

   1. check the current journal mode on your database
      using::

        sqlite3 <tracker_home>/db/db "pragma journal_mode;"

   2. If it returns ``delete``, change it to WAL mode using::

        sqlite3 <tracker_home>/db/db "pragma journal_mode=WAL;"

   3. verify by running the command in step 1 again and you
      should get ``wal``.

If you are using SQLite for session and otk databases,
perform the same steps replacing ``db`` with ``db-session``
and ``db-otk``.

If you find WAL mode is not working for you, you can set the
journal method to a rollback journal (``delete`` mode) by
using step 2 and replacing ``wal`` with ``delete``. (Note:
SQLite supports other journaling modes, but only ``wal`` and
``delete`` persist. Roundup doesn't set a journaling mode
when it opens the database, so journaling mode options such
as ``truncate`` are not useful.)

For details on WAL mode see `<https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html>`_
and `<https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode>`_.

Change in processing allowed_api_origins setting (info)
-------------------------------------------------------

In this release you can use both ``*`` (as the first origin) and
explicit origins in the ``allowed_api_origins`` setting in
``config.ini``. (Before it was only one or the other.)

You do not need to use ``*``. If you do, it allows any client
anonymous (unauthenticated) access to the Roundup tracker. This
is the same as browsing the tracker without logging in. If they
try to provide credentials, access to the data will be denied by
`CORS`_.

If you include explicit origins (e.g. \https://example.com),
users from those origins will not be blocked if they use
credentials to log in.

.. _CORS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS

Change in processing of In-Reply_to email header (info)
-------------------------------------------------------

Messages received via email usually include a ``[issue23]``
designator in the subject line. This indicates what issue is
being updated. If the designator is missing, Roundup tries
to find the correct issue by using the in-reply-to email
header.

The former code appends the new message to the first issue
found with a message matching the in-reply-to
header. Usually a message is associated with only one
issue. However nothing in Roundup requires that.

In this release, the in-reply-to matching is disabled if
there are multiple issues with the same message. In this
case, subject matching is used to try to find the matching
issue.

If you don't have messages assigned to multiple issues you
will see no change. If you do have multi-linked messages
this will hopefully result in better message->issue
matching.

Incremental/batch full test reindexing with roundup-admin (info)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The ``reindex`` command in ``roundup-admin`` can reindex
a range of items. For example::

  roundup-admin -i ... reindex issues:1-1000

will reindex only the first 1000 issues. This is useful since
reindexing can take a while and slow down the tracker. By running
it in batches you can control when the reindex runs rather than having
to wait for it to complete all the reindexing. See the man page or
`administration guide`_ for details.

.. index:: Upgrading; 2.1.0 to 2.2.0

Migrating from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0
=============================

Update your ``config.ini`` (required)
-------------------------------------

Upgrade tracker's config.ini file. Use::

  roundup-admin -i /path/to/tracker updateconfig newconfig.ini

to generate a new ini file preserving all your settings.
You can then merge any local comments from the tracker's
``config.ini`` to ``newconfig.ini`` and replace
``config.ini`` with ``newconfig.ini``.

Rdbms version change from 6 to 7 (required)
-------------------------------------------

This release includes two changes that require updates to the database
schema:

  1. The size of words included in the Roundup FTS indexers have been
     increased from 25 to 50. This requires changes to the database
     columns used by the native indexer.  This also affect the whoosh
     and xapian indexers.
  2. Some databases that include native full-text search (native-fts
     indexer) searching are now supported.

You should run the ``roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> migrate`` command
for all your trackers once you've installed the latest codebase.

Do this before you use the web, command-line or mail interface
and before any users access the tracker.

If successful, this command will respond with either "Tracker
updated" (if you've not previously run it on an RDBMS backend) or
"No migration action required" (if you have run it, or have used
another interface to the tracker, or are using anydbm).

See `below if you want to enable native-fts searching`_.

.. _below if you want to enable native-fts searching: \
    #enhanced-full-text-search-optional

The increase in indexed word length also affects whoosh and xapian
backends. You may want to run ``roundup-admin -i tracker_home
reindex`` if you want to index or search for longer words in your full
text searches. Re-indexing make take some time.

Check new login_empty_passwords setting (required)
--------------------------------------------------

In this version of Roundup, users with a blank password are not
allowed to login. Blank passwords have been allowed since 2002, but
2022 is a different time. If you have a use case that requires a user
to login without a password, set the ``login_empty_passwords`` setting
in the ``web`` section of ``config.ini`` to ``yes``. In
general this should be left at its default value of ``no``.

Verify that SQLite supports FTS5 (required)
-------------------------------------------

If you use SQLite as your backend, it *must* support FTS5.  See the
`FTS5 testing steps`_ for how to verify this.

.. _FTS5 testing steps: installation.html#fts5-testing

Check allowed_api_origins setting (optional)
--------------------------------------------

If you are using the REST or xmlrpc api's from an origin
that is different from your roundup tracker, you will need
to add your allowed origins to the allowed_api_origins in
your updated ``config.ini``. Upgrade your ``config.ini`` as
described above then read the documentation for the setting
in ``config.ini``.

Check compression settings (optional)
-------------------------------------

Read the `administration guide`_ section on `Configuring Compression`_.

Upgrade your tracker's config.ini as described
above. Compare the old and new files and configure new
compression settings as you want. Then replace
``config.ini`` with the ``newconfig.ini`` file.

Search added to user index page (optional)
------------------------------------------

A search form and count of number of hits has been added to the
``user.index.html`` template page in the classic template. You may
want to merge the search form and footer into your template.

Enhanced full-text search (optional)
------------------------------------

SQLite's `FTS5 full-text search engine`_ is available as is
`PostgreSQL's full text search`_. Both require a schema upgrade so you
should run::

  roundup-admin -i tracker_home migrate

to create FTS specific tables before restarting the roundup-web or
email interfaces.

SQLite 3.9.0+ or PostgreSQL 11.0+ are required to use this feature.
When using SQLite, all full text search fields will allow searching
using the MATCH query format described at:
https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html#full_text_query_syntax. When using
PostgreSQL either the websearch_to_tsquery or to_tsquery formats
described on
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-PARSING-QUERIES
can be used. The default is websearch. Prefixing the search with
``ts:`` enables tsquery mode.

A list of words behaves almost the same as the default text search
(``native``). So the search string ``fts search`` will find all issues
that have both of those words (an AND search) in a text-field (like
title) or in a message (or file) attached to the issue.

One thing to note is that native-fts searches do not ignore words
longer than 50 characters or less than 2 characters. Also SQLite does
not filter out common words (i.e. there is no stopword list). So words
like "and", "or", "then", "with" ...  are included in the FTS5 search.

You must explicitly enable this search mechanism by changing the
``indexer`` setting in ``config.ini`` to ``native-fts``. Native-fts
must be explicitly chosen. This is different from Xapian or Whoosh
indexers, which are chosen if they are installed in the Python
environment. This prevents the existing native indexing from being
discarded if ``indexer`` is not set.

Next re-index your data with ``roundup-admin -i tracker_home
reindex``. This can take a while depending on the size of the tracker.

You may want to update your ``config.ini`` by following the directions
above to get the latest documentation.

See the `administration guide notes on native-fts`_ for further details.

Adding error reporting templates (optional)
-------------------------------------------

Currently some internal errors result in a bare html page with an
error message. The usual chrome supplied by page.html is not shown.
For example query language syntax errors for full text search methods
will display a bare HTML error page.

If you add an ``_generic.400.html`` template to the html directory, you
can display the error inside of the layout provided by the ``page.html``
template. This can make fixing the error and navigation easier. You
can use the ``_generic.404.html`` template to create a
``_generic.400.html`` by modifying the title and body text. You can test
the 400 template by appending ``@template=400`` to the url for the
tracker.

Change passwords using crypt module (optional)
----------------------------------------------

The crypt module is being removed from the standard library.  Any
stored password using crypt encoding will fail to verify once the
crypt module is removed (expected in Python 3.13 see `pep-0594
<https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/>`_). Automatic migration of
passwords (if enabled in config.ini) re-encrypts old passwords using
something other than crypt if a user logs in using the web interface.

You can find users with passwords still encrypted using crypt by
running::

    roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> table password,id,username

Look for lines starting with ``{CRYPT}``. You can reset the user's
password using::

    roundup-admin -i <tracker_home>
    roundup> set user16 password=somenewpassword

changing ``16`` to the id in the second column of the table output.
The example uses interactive mode (indicated by the ``roundup>``
prompt). This prevents the new password from showing up in the output
of ps or shell history. The new password will be encrypted using the
default encryption method (usually pbkdf2).

Enable performance improvement for wsgi mode (optional)
-------------------------------------------------------

There is an experimental wsgi performance improvement mode that caches
the loaded roundup instance. This eliminates disk reads that are
incurred on each connection. In one report it improves speed by a
factor of 2 to 3 times. To enable this you should add a feature flag
to your Roundup wsgi wrapper (see the file
``.../share/frontends/wsgi.py``) so it looks like::

   feature_flags = { "cache_tracker": "" }
   app =  RequestDispatcher(tracker_home, feature_flags=feature_flags)

to enable this mode. Note that this is experimental and was added
during the 2.2.0 beta period, so it is enabled using a feature flag.
If you use this and it works for you please followup with an email to
the roundup-users at lists.sourceforge.net mailing list so we can
enable it by default in a future release.


Hide submit button during readonly use of _generic.item.html (optional)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The submit button in _generic.item.html always shows up even when the
user doesn't have edit perms. Change the ``context/submit`` html to
read::

   <td colspan=3 tal:content="structure context/submit"
       tal:condition="context/is_edit_ok">

in your TAL based templates. The ``jinja2`` based templates are
missing this file, but if you implemented one you want to surround the
jinja2 code with::

  {% if context.is_edit_ok() %}
    <submit button code here>
  {% endif %}


.. index:: Upgrading; 2.0.0 to 2.1.0

Migrating from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0
=============================

Rdbms version change from 5 to 6 (required)
-------------------------------------------

To fix an issue with importing databases, the database has to be
upgraded for rdbms backends.

You should run the ``roundup-admin migrate`` command for your
tracker once you've installed the latest codebase.

Do this before you use the web, command-line or mail interface
and before any users access the tracker.

If successful, this command will respond with either "Tracker
updated" (if you've not previously run it on an RDBMS backend) or
"No migration action required" (if you have run it, or have used
another interface to the tracker, or are using anydbm).

This only changes the schema for the mysql backend. It has no
effect other than upgrading the revision on other rdbms backends.

On the mysql backend it creates the database index that makes
sure the key field for your class is unique.

If your update/migration fails, you will see an::

   IntegrityError: (1062, "Duplicate entry '0-NULL' for key '_user_key_retired_idx'")

it means you have two non-retired members of the class with the
same key field. E.G. two non-retired users with the same
username.

Debug this using roundup-admin using the list command. For
example dump the user class by the key field ``username``::

   $ roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> list user username
     1: admin
     2: anonymous
     3: demo
     4: agent
     5: provisional
     6: foo@example.com
     7: dupe
     8: dupe
     ...

then search the usernames for duplicates. Once you have
identified the duplicate username (``dupe`` above), you should
retire the other active duplicates or change the username for the
duplicate.  To retire ``7: dupe``, you run::

   roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> retire user7

(use ``restore user7`` if you retired the wrong item).  If you
want to rename the entry use::

   roundup-admin -i <tracker_home> set user7 username=dupe1

Keep doing this until you have no more duplicates. Then run the
update/migrate again.

If you have duplicate non-retired entries in your database,
please email roundup-users at lists.sourceforge.net. We are
interested in how many issues this has caused. Duplicate creation
should occur only when two or more mysql processes run in
parallel and both of them creating an item with the same key. So
this should be a rare event. The internal duplicate prevention
checks should work in other cases.

For the nerds: if you had a new installation that was created at
version 5, the uniqueness of a key was not enforced at the
database level. If you had a database that was at version 4 and
then upgraded to version 5 you have the uniqueness enforcing
constraint. Running migrate updates to schema version 6 and installs
the unique index constraint if it is missing.

Setuptools is now required to install (info)
--------------------------------------------

Roundup install now uses setuptools rather than distutils. You must
install setuptools.  Use the version packgaged by your OS vendor.  If
your OS vendor doesn't supply setuptools use ``pip install
setuptools``. (You may need pip3 rather than pip if using python3.)

Define Authentication Header (optional)
---------------------------------------

The web server in front of roundup (apache, nginx) can perform user
authentication. It can pass the authenticated username to the backend
in a variable. By default roundup looks for the ``REMOTE_USER``
variable. This can be changed by setting the parameter
``http_auth_header`` in the ``[web]`` section of the tracker's
``config.ini`` file to a different value. The value is case sensitive.
If the value is unset (the default) the REMOTE_USER variable is used.

If you are running roundup using ``roundup-server`` behind a proxy
that authenticates the user you need to configure ``roundup-server``
to pass the HTTP header with the authenticated username to the
tracker. By default ``roundup-server`` looks for the ``REMOTE_USER``
header for the authenticated user.  You can copy an arbitrary header
variable to the tracker using the ``-I`` option to roundup-server (or
the equivalent option in the roundup-server config file).

For example to use the ``uid_variable`` header, two configuration
changes are needed: First configure ``roundup-server`` to pass the
header to the tracker using::

  roundup-server -I uid_variable ....

note that the header is passed exactly as supplied by the upstream
server. It is **not** prefixed with ``HTTP_`` like other headers since
you are explicitly allowing the header. Multiple comma separated
headers can be passed to the ``-I`` option. These could be used in a
detector or other tracker extensions, but only one header can be used
by the tracker as an authentication header.

To make the tracker honor the new variable changing the tracker
``config.ini`` to read::

  [web]
  ...
  http_auth_header = uid_variable

At the time this is written, support is experimental. If you use it
you should notify the roundup maintainers using the roundup-users
at lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

Classname Format Enforced (info)
--------------------------------

Check schema.py and look at all Class(), IssueClass(), FileClass()
calls. The second argument is the classname. All classnames must:

   * start with an alphabetic character
   * consist of alphanumerics and '_'
   * not end with a digit

this was not enforced before. Using non-standard classnames could lead
to other issues.

jQuery updated with updates to user.help.html (recommended)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The devel and responsive templates shipped with an old version of
jQuery with some security issues. It has been updated to the current
version: 3.5.1. If your tracker is based on one of these templates
(see the ``TEMPLATE-INFO.txt`` file in your tracker), remove the old
``html/jquery.js`` file from your tracker and copy the new
``jquery-3.5.1.js`` file from the template directory to your tracker's
``html`` directory. Also copy in the new ``user.help.html`` file. It now
references the new ``jquery-3.5.1.js`` file and also fixes a bug that
prevented applying the change from the helper to the field on the main
form.

Roundup-admin security stops on incorrect properties (info)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The ``roundup-admin ... security`` command used to continue
running through the rest of the security roles after reporting a
property error. Now it stops after reporting the incorrect property.

If run non-interactively, it exits with status 1. It can now be
used in a startup script to detect permission errors.

Futureproof devel and responsive timezone selection extension (recommended)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The devel and responsive (derived from devel) templates use a select
control to list all available timezones when pytz is used. It
sanitizes the data using cgi.escape. Cgi.escape is deprecated and
removed in newer pythons. Change your ``extensions/timezone.py``
file by applying the following patch manually::


    -import cgi
    +try:
    +    from html import escape
    +except ImportError:
    +    from cgi import escape

     try:

Python 2 MYSQL users MUST READ (required)
-----------------------------------------

To fix issues with encoding of data and text searching, roundup now
explicitly sets the database connection character set. Roundup prior
to 2.0 used the default character set which was not always utf-8. All
roundup data is manipulated in utf-8. This mismatch causes issues with
searches and result in corrupted data in the database if it was not
properly represented across the charset conversions.

This issue exists when running roundup under python 2. Note that there
are more changes required for running roundup 2.0 if you choose to use
python3. See `Python 3 support`_.

In an upgraded ``config.ini`` (see next section) the ``[rdbms]``
section has a key ``mysql_charset`` set by default to ``utf8mb4``.

It should be possible to change ``utf8mb4`` to any mysql charset. So
if you know what charset is enabled (e.g. via a setting in ~roundup/.my.cnf,
or the default charset for the database) you can set it in
``config.ini`` and not need to covert the database. However the
underlying issues with misconverted data and bad searches will still
exist if they did before.

None of the roundup developers run mysql, so the exact steps to take
during the upgrade were tested with test and not production databases.

**Before doing anything else:**

   Backup the mysql database using mysql dump or other mysql
   supported tool.

   Backup roundup using your current backup tool and take the roundup
   instance offline.

Then the following steps (similar to the conversion in needed for
Python 3) should work:

1. Export the tracker database
   using your **current** 1.6 instance::

     roundup-admin -i <trackerdir> exporttables <export_dir>

   replacing tracker_dir and export_dir as appropriate.

2. Import the exported database using the **new** 2.0 roundup::

     roundup-admin -i <trackerdir> importtables <export_dir>

   replacing tracker_dir and export_dir as appropriate.

The imported data should overwrite the original data. Note it is
critically important that the ``exporttables`` be done with the *old
tracker* and the ``importtables`` be done with the *new tracker*. An
import/export cycle between roundup 1.6.0 and roundup 2.0 has been
done successfully. So the export format for 1.6 and 2.0 should be
compatible.

Note that ``importtables`` is new in roundup-2.0, so you will not be
able to import the result of ``exporttables`` using any 1.x version of
roundup.

Following the same sequence as above using ``export`` and ``import``
should also work, but it will export all the files and messages. This
will take longer but may be worth trying if the ``exporttables`` and
``importtables`` method fails for some reason.

Another way that should be faster, but is untested is to use mysql
dump to dump the database.
https://makandracards.com/makandra/595-dumping-and-importing-from-to-mysql-in-an-utf-8-safe-way
recommends:

   Note that when your MySQL server is not set to UTF-8 you need to do
   mysqldump --default-character-set=latin1 (!) to get a correctly
   encoded dump. In that case you will also need to remove the SET
   NAMES='latin1' comment at the top of the dump, so the target machine
   won't change its UTF-8 charset when sourcing.

Then import the dump. Removing ``SET NAMES`` should allow the import
to use UTF-8.

Please report success or issues with this conversion to the
roundup-users at lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

As people report successful or unsuccessful conversions, we will update
the errata page at: https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/ReleaseErrata.

Upgrade tracker's config.ini file (recommended)
-----------------------------------------------

Once you have installed the new roundup, use::

  roundup-admin -i /path/to/tracker updateconfig newconfig.ini

to generate a new ini file preserving all your settings. You can then
merge any local comments from the tracker's ``config.ini`` into
``newconfig.ini``. Compare the old and new files and configure any new
settings as you want. Then replace ``config.ini`` with the
``newconfig.ini`` file.

.. _Python 3 support:

Python 3 support (info)
-----------------------

Many of the ``.html`` and ``.py`` files from Roundup that are copied
into tracker directories have changed for Python 3 support.  If you
wish to move an existing tracker to Python 3, you need to merge in
those changes. Also you need to make sure that locally created python
code in the tracker is correct for Python 3.

If your tracker uses the ``anydbm`` or ``mysql`` backends, you also
need to export the tracker contents using ``roundup-admin export``
running under Python 2, and them import them using ``roundup-admin
import`` running under Python 3. This is detailed in the documention
for migrating to a different backend.  If using the ``sqlite`` backend,
you do not need to export and import, but need to delete the
``db/otks`` and ``db/sessions`` files when changing Python version.
If using the ``postgresql`` backend, you do not need to export and
import and no other special database-related steps are needed.

If you use the whoosh indexer, you will need to reindex. It looks like
a database created with Python 2 leads to Unicode decode errors when
accessed by Python 3. Reindexing can take a while (see details below
look for "reindexing").

Octal values in config.ini change from the Python 2 representation
with a leading ``0`` (``022``). They now use a leading ``0o``
(``0o22``). Note that the ``0o`` format is properly handled under
python 2. You can use the ``newconfig.ini`` generated using ``python3
roundup-admin -i ... updateconfig newconfig.ini`` if you want to go
back to using python 2. (Note going back to Python 2 will require
the same steps as moving from 2 to 3 except using Python 3 to perform
the export.)

Rate Limit New User Registration (info)
---------------------------------------

The new user registration form can be abused by bots to allow
automated registration for spamming. This can be limited by using the
new ``config.ini`` ``[web]`` option called
``registration_delay``. The default is 4 and is the number of seconds
between the time the form was generated and the time the form is
processed.

If you do not modify the ``user.register.html`` template in your
tracker's html directory, you *must* set this to 0. Otherwise you will
see the error:

.. code-block:: text

  Form is corrupted, missing: opaqueregister.

If set to 0, the rate limit check is disabled.

If you want to use this, you can change your ``user.register.html``
file to include::

 <input type="hidden" name="opaqueregister" tal:attributes="value python: utils.timestamp()">

The hidden input field can be placed right after the form declaration
that starts with::

   <form method="POST" onSubmit="return submit_once()"

If you have applied Erik Forsberg's tracker level patch to implement
(see: https://hg.python.org/tracker/python-dev/rev/83477f735132), you
can back the code out of the tracker. You must change the name of the
field in the html template to ``opaqueregistration`` from ``opaque``
in order to use the core code.

PGP mail processing (required)
------------------------------

Roundup now uses the ``gpg`` module instead of ``pyme`` to process PGP
mail.  If you have PGP processing enabled, make sure the ``gpg``
module is installed.

MySQL client module (recommended)
---------------------------------

Although the ``MySQLdb`` module from
https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/ is still supported, it is
recommended to switch to the updated module from
https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/.

XMLRPC Access Role (info/required)
----------------------------------

A new permission has been added to control access to the XMLRPC
endpoint. If the user doesn't have the new "Xmlrpc Access" permission,
they will not be able to log in using the /xmlrpc end point.  To add
this new permission to the "User" role you should change your
tracker's schema.py and add::

    db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', 'Xmlrpc Access')

This is usually included near where other permissions like "Web Access"
or "Email Access" are assigned.

New values for db.tx_Source (info)
----------------------------------

The database attribute tx_Source reports "xmlrpc" and "rest" when the
/xmlrpc and /rest web endpoints are used. Check all code (extensions,
detectors, lib) in trackers looking for tx_Source. If you have code
like::

    if db.tx_Source == "web":

or::

    if db.tx_Source in ['web', 'email-sig-openpgp', 'cli' ]:

you may need to change these to include matches to "rest" and
"xmlrpc". For example::

    if db.tx_Source in [ "web", "rest", "xmlrpc" ]

or::

    if db.tx_Source in ['web', 'rest', 'xmlrpc', 'email-sig-openpgp', 'cli' ]:


CSV export changes (info)
-------------------------

The original Roundup CSV export function for indexes reported id
numbers for links. The wiki had a version that resolved the id's to
names, so it would report ``open`` rather than ``2`` or
``user2;user3`` rather than ``[2,3]``.

Many people added the enhanced version to their extensions directory.

The enhanced version was made the default in roundup 2.0.  If you want
to use the old version (that returns id's), you can replace references
to ``export_csv`` with ``export_csv_id`` in templates.

Both core csv export functions have been changed to force quoting of
all exported fields. To incorporate this change in any CSV export
extension you may have added, change references in your code from::

    writer = csv.writer(wfile)

to::

    writer = csv.writer(wfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)

this forces all (non-numeric) fields to be quoted and empty quotes to
be added for missing parameters.

This turns exported values that may look like formulas into strings so
some versions of Excel won't try to interpret them as a formula.

Update userauditor.py to restrict usernames (recommended)
---------------------------------------------------------

A username can be created with embedded commas and < and >
characters. Even though the < and > are usually escaped when
displayed, the embedded comma makes it difficult to edit lists of
users as they are comma separated.

If you have not modified your tracker's userauditor.py, you can just
copy the userauditor.py from the classic template into your tracker's
detectors directory. Otherwise merge the changes from the template
userauditor.py. https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550921 may be
helpful.

Consider reindexing if you use European languages (recommended)
---------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of bugs dealing with incorrect indexing of European languages
(Russian and German were reported) have been fixed. Note reindexing
all your data may take a long time. See:
https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue1195739 and
https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue1344046 for a description of
the problem. If you determine that this a problem for your tracker,
you can use::

  roundup-admin -i /path/to/tracker reindex

to rewrite your full text indexes. The tracker used for reindex timing
had 140MB of file/message data and 2500 issues with a slow 5400RPM
SATA drive. Using native indexing with sqlite took about 45
minutes. Using whoosh took about 2 hours. Using xapian took about 6
hours. All examples were with Python 2. Anecdotal evidence shows
Python 3 is faster, but YMMV.

Merge improvements in statusauditor.py (optional)
-------------------------------------------------

By default the detector statusauditor.py will change the status from
"unread" to "chatting" when a second message is added to an issue.
The distributed classic and jinja templates implement this feature in
their copies of ``detectors/statusauditor.py``.

This can be a problem. Consider a person sending email to create an
issue. Then the person sends a followup message to add some additional
information to the issue. The followup message will trigger the status
change from "unread" to "chatting". This is misleading since the
person is "chatting" with themselves.

Statusauditor.py has been enhanced to prevent the status from changing
to "chatting" until a second user (person) adds a message.  If you
want this functionality, you need to merge the distributed
statusauditor.py with your tracker's statusauditor.py. If you have not
customised your tracker's statusauditor.py, copy the one from the
distibuted template. In addition to the python file, you also must
copy/merge the distributed ``detectors/config.ini`` into your
tracker's detectors directory. Most people can copy
``detectors/config.ini`` from the distributed templates as they won't
have a ``detectors/config.ini`` file. (Note this is
``detectors/config.ini`` do not confuse it with the main
``config.ini`` file at the root of the tracker home.)

This enhancement is disabled by default. Enable it by changing the
value in ``detectors/config.ini`` from::

   chatting_requires_two_users = False

to::

   chatting_requires_two_users = True

(the values ``no`` and ``yes`` can also be used). Restart the tracker
to enable the change.

If you don't do this quite right you will see one of two error
messages in the web interface when you try to update an issue with a
message::

   Edit Error: Unsupported configuration option: Option
      STATUSAUDITOR_CHATTING_REQUIRES_TWO_USERS not found in
      detectors/config.ini.
   Contact tracker admin to fix.

This happens if detectors/config.ini is not found or is missing the
``chatting_requires_two_users`` option in the ``statusauditor``
section.

If you have an incorrect value (say you use ``T`` rather than
``True``) you see a different error::

   Edit Error: Invalid value for
     DETECTOR::STATUSAUDITOR_CHATTING_REQUIRES_TWO_USERS: 'T'
   Allowed values: yes, no

to fix this set the value to ``yes`` (True) or ``no`` (False).

Responsive template changes (optional)
--------------------------------------

There have been some changes to the responsive template. You can
diff/merge these changes into your responsive template based tracker.

Jinja template changes (required)
---------------------------------

Auto escaping has been enabled in the jinja template engine, this
means it is no longer necessary to manually escape dynamic strings
with ``|e``, but strings that should not be escaped need to be marked
with ``|safe`` (e.g. ``{{ context.history()|u|safe }}``). Also, the i18n
extension has been enabled and the template has been updated to use
the extension for translatable text instead of explicit ``i18n.gettext``
calls::

   {% trans %}List of issues{% endtrans %}

instead of::

   {{ i18n.gettext('List of issues')|u }}

The jinja template has been upgraded to use bootstrap 4.1.3 (from
2.2.2). You can diff/merge changes into your jinja template based
tracker.

Also search _generic.index.html, navigation.html and file.index.html
in the html directory of your tracker. Look for::

   <input type="hidden" name="@action"

where the value is a jinja expression that calls i18n.gettext. Set the
value to the argument of the gettext call. E.G. replace::

    <input type="hidden" name="@action" value="{{ i18n.gettext('editCSV')|u }}">

with::

    <input type="hidden" name="@action" value="editCSV">

The action keywords should not be translated.

.. index:: Upgrading; 1.5.1 to 1.6.0

Migrating from 1.5.1 to 1.6.0
=============================

Update tracker config file
--------------------------

After installing the new version of roundup, you should
update the ``config.ini`` file for your tracker. To do this:

1. backup your existing ``config.ini`` file
2. using the newly installed code, run::

      roundup-admin -i /path/to/tracker updateconfig config.ini.new

   to create the file config.ini.new. Replace
   ``/path/to/tracker`` with the path to your tracker.
3. replace your tracker's config.ini with config.ini.new

Using updateconfig keeps all the settings from your
tracker's config.ini file and adds settings for all the new
options.

If you have added comments to your original config.ini file,
merge the added comments into the config.ini.new file.  Then
replace your tracker's config.ini with config.ini.new.

Read the new config.ini and configure it to enable new
features. Details on using these features can be found in
this section.

Make sure that user can view labelprop on classes (required)
------------------------------------------------------------

If you have View permissions that use ``properties=...``, make sure
that the `labelprop <reference.html#setlabelprop-property>`_ for the
class is listed in the properties list.

The first one of these that exists must must be in the list:

 1. the property set by a call to setlabelprop for the class
 2. the key of the class (as set by setkey())
 3. the "name" property (if it exists)
 4. the "title" property (if it exists)

if none of those apply, you must allow

 * the "id" property

E.G. If your class does a setlabelprop("foo") you must include "foo"
in the properties list even if the class has name or title properties.

See: `reference.html setlabelprop
<reference.html#setlabelprop-property>`_ for further details on the
labelprop.

If you don't do this, you will find that multilinks (and possibly
links) may not be displayed properly. E.G. templates that iterate over
a mutlilink field (with tal:repeat for example) may not show any
content.

See: https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/mailman/message/35763294/
for the initial discussion of the issue.

.. _cross site request forgery detection added:

Cross Site Request Forgery Detection Added (recommended)
--------------------------------------------------------

Roundup 1.6. supports a number of defenses against CSRF.

Http header verification against the tracker's ``web``
setting in the ``[tracker]`` section of config.ini for the
following headers:

1. Analyze the ``Referer`` HTTP header to make sure it
   includes the web setting.
2. Analyze the ``Origin`` HTTP header to make sure the
   schema://host matches the web setting.
3. Analyze the ``X-Forwarded-Host`` header set by a proxy
   running in front of roundup to make sure it agrees with
   the host part of the web setting.
4. Analyze the ``Host`` header to make sure it agrees with
   the host part of the web setting. This is not done if
   ``X-Forwarded-Host`` is set.

By default roundup 1.6 does not require any specific header
to be present. However at least one of the headers above
*must* pass validation checks (usually ``Host`` or
``Referer``) or the submission is rejected with an error.
If any header fails validation, the submission is
rejected. (Note the user's form keeps all the data they
entered if it was rejected.)

Also the admin can include unique csrf tokens for all forms
submitted using the POST method. (Delete and put methods are also
included, but not currently used by roundup.) The csrf
token (nonce) is tied to the user's session. When the user
submits the form and nonce, the nonce is checked to make
sure it was issued to the user and the same session. If this
is not true the post is rejected and the user is notified.

The standard context/submit templating item creates CSRF tokens by
default. If you have forms using the POST method that are not using
the standard submit routine, you should add the following field to all
forms::

   <input name="@csrf" type="hidden"
      tal:attributes="value python:utils.anti_csrf_nonce()">

A unique random token is generated by every call to
utils.anti_csrf_nonce() and is put in a database to be
retreived if the token is used. Token lifetimes are 2 weeks
by default but can be configured in config.ini. Roundup will
automatically prune old tokens. Calling anti_csrf_nonce with
an integer lifetime, for example::

   <input name="@csrf" type="hidden"
      tal:attributes="value python:utils.anti_csrf_nonce(lifetime=10)">

sets the lifetime of that nonce to 10 minutes.

If you want to change the default settings, you have to
update the web section in your tracker's config.ini file. Follow the
section above to generate an updated config.ini file. Then
look for settings that start with csrf. The updated config.ini
file includes detailed descriptions of the settings.

In general one of four values can be set for these
settings. The default is ``yes``, which validates the header
or nonce and blocks access if the validation fails. If the
field/header is missing it allows access. Setting these
fields to ``required`` blocks access if the header/nonce is
missing.

It is recommended that you change your templates so every form
that is not submitted via GET has an @csrf field. Then change
the csrf_enforce_token setting to 'required'.

Errors and Troubleshooting - @csrf in url
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see the @csrf nonce in the URL, you have added the value to a
form that uses the GET method. You should remove the @csrf token from
these forms as it is not needed.

Errors and Troubleshooting - AttributeError list object no attribute value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you get an error:

.. code-block:: text

  AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'value'

in handle_csrf, you have more than one @csrf token for the form. This
usually occurs because the form uses the standard context/submit
element but you also added an explicit @csrf statement. Simply remove
the @csrf element for that form.

Errors and Troubleshooting - xmlrpc Required Header Missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When performing and xmlrpc call, if you see something like::

  xmlrpclib.Fault: <Fault 1: "<class
     'roundup.exceptions.UsageError'>:Required Header Missing">

change your xmlrpc client to add appropriate headers to
the request including the:

  X-Requested-With:

header as well as any other required csrf headers (e.g. referer,
origin) configured in config.ini. See the `advanced python client
<xmlrpc.html#advanced-python-client-adding-anti-csrf-headers>`_ at
the end of the xmlrpc guide.

Alternatively change the setting of
csrf_enforce_header_x-requested-with in config.ini to ``no``. So it
looks like::

  csrf_enforce_header_x-requested-with = no

This is not recommended as it reduces csrf protection.


Support for SameSite cookie option for session cookie
-----------------------------------------------------

Support for serving the session cookie using the SameSite cookie option
has been added. By default it is set to lax to provide a better user
experience. But this can be changed to strict or the option can be
removed entirely.

Using the process for merging config.ini changes described in
`Cross Site Request Forgery Detection Added`_ you can add the
``samesite_cookie_setting`` to the ``[web]`` section of the config
file.

Fix for path traversal changes template resolution
--------------------------------------------------

The templates in the tracker's html subdirectory must not be
symbolic links that lead outside of the html directory.

If you don't use symbolic links for templates in your html
subdirectory you don't have to make any changes. Otherwise you need to
replace the symbolic links with hard links to the files or replace the
symbolic links with the files.

This is a side effect of fixing a path traversal security issue.  The
security issue required a directory with a specific unusual name. This
made it difficult to exploit. However allowing the use of
subdirectories to organize the templates required that it be fixed.


Database back end specified in config.ini (required)
----------------------------------------------------

The ``db/backend_name`` file is no longer used to configure the database
backend being used for a tracker. The backend is now configured in the
``config.ini`` file using the ``backend`` option located in the ``[rdbms]``
section. For example if ``db/backend_name`` file contains ``sqlite``, a new
entry in the tracker's ``config.ini`` will need to be created::

  [rdbms]

  ...

  # Database backend.
  # Default:
  backend = sqlite

Once the ``config.ini`` file has been updated with the new ``backend`` option,
you can safely delete the ``db/backend_name`` file.

Note: the ``backend_name`` file may be located in a directory other than
``db/`` if you have configured the ``database`` option in the ``[main]``
section of the ``config.ini`` file to be something other than ``db``.

Note 2: if you are using the anydbm back end, you still set
it using the backend option in the rdbms section of the
config.ini file.

New config file option 'indexer' added
--------------------------------------

This release added support for the Whoosh indexer, so a new
config file option has been
added. You can force Roundup to use a particular text indexer by
setting this value in the [main] section of the tracker's
``config.ini`` file (usually placed right before indexer_stopwords)::

  [main]

  ...

  # Force Roundup to use a particular text indexer.
  # If no indexer is supplied, the first available indexer
  # will be used in the following order:
  # Possible values: xapian, whoosh, native (internal).
  indexer =

Errors and Troubleshooting - Full text searching not working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If after the upgrade full text searching is not working try changing
the indexer value. If this is failing most likely you need to set
'''indexer = native''' to use the rdbms or db text indexing systems.

Alternatively you can do a
'''roundup-admin -i /path/to/tracker reindex'''
to generate a new index using roundup's preferred indexer from the
list above.

Xapian error with flint when reindexing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you reindex and are using xapian, you may get the error that
"flint" is not supported (looks like flint was removed after xapian
1.2.x). To fix this, you can delete the full text search database
located in the tracker home directory in the file '''db/text-index'''
and then perform a reindex.

Stemming improved in Xapian Indexer
-----------------------------------

Stemming allows a search for "silent" also match silently.  The Porter
stemmer in Xapian works with lowercase English text. In this release we
lowercase the documents as they are put into the indexer.

This means capitalization is not preserved, but produces more hits by
using the stemmer.

You will need to do a roundup-admin reindex if you are using the
Xapian full text indexer on your tracker.


New config file option 'replyto_address' added
----------------------------------------------

A new config file option has been added to let you control the
Reply-To header on nosy messages.

Edit your tracker's ``config.ini`` and place the following after
the email entry in the tracker section::

  [tracker]
  ...

  # Controls the reply-to header address used when sending
  # nosy messages.
  # If the value is unset (default) the roundup tracker's
  # email address (above) is used.
  # If set to "AUTHOR" then the primary email address of the
  # author of the change will be used as the reply-to
  # address. This allows email exchanges to occur outside of
  # the view of roundup and exposes the address of the person
  # who updated the issue, but it could be useful in some
  # unusual circumstances.
  # If set to some other value, the value is used as the reply-to
  # address. It must be a valid RFC2822 address or people will not be
  # able to reply.
  # Default:
  replyto_address =

Login from a search or after logout works better (required)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The login form has been improved to work with some back end code
changes. Now when a user logs in they stay on the same page where they
started the login. To make this work, you must change the tal that is
used to set the ``__came_from`` form variable. Note that the url
assigned to __came_from must be url encoded/quoted and be under the
tracker's base url. If the base_url uses http, you can set the url to
https.

Replace the existing code in the tracker's html/page.html page that
looks similar to (look for name="__came_from"):

.. code::
   :class: big-code

   <input type="hidden" name="__came_from" tal:attributes="value string:${request/base}${request/env/PATH_INFO}">

with the following:

.. code:: html
  :class: big-code

  <input type="hidden" name="__came_from"
    tal:condition="exists:request/env/QUERY_STRING"
    tal:attributes="value string:${request/base}${request/env/PATH_INFO}?${request/env/QUERY_STRING}">
  <input type="hidden" name="__came_from"
    tal:condition="not:exists:request/env/QUERY_STRING"
    tal:attributes="value string:${request/base}${request/env/PATH_INFO}">

Now search backwards for the nearest form statement before the code
that sets __came_from. If it looks like::

     <form method="post" action="#">

replace it with::

     <form method="post" tal:attributes="action request/base">

or with::

     <form method="post" tal:attributes="action string:${request/env/PATH_INFO}">

the important part is that the action field **must not** include any query
parameters ('#' includes query params).

Errors and Troubleshooting - Unrecognized scheme in ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One symptom of failing to do this is getting an error:

   Unrecognized scheme in ....

where the .... changes depending on the url path. You can see this
when logging in from any screen other than the main index.

Option to make adding multiple keywords more convenient
-------------------------------------------------------

In the classic tracker, after adding a new keyword you are redirected
to the page for the new keyword so you can change the keyword's
name. This is usually not desirable as you usually correctly set the
keyword's name when creating the keyword. The new classic tracker has
a new checkbox (checked by default) that keeps you on the same page so
you can add a new keywords one after the other.

To add this to your own tracker, add the following code (prefixed with
a +) after the entry box for the new keyword in html/keyword.item.html:

.. code::

      <tr>
       <th i18n:translate="">Keyword</th>
       <td tal:content="structure context/name/field">name</td>
   +   <td tal:condition="not:context/id">
   +     <tal:comment tal:replace="nothing">
   +       If we get here and do not have an id, we are creating a new
   +       keyword. It would be nice to provide some mechanism to
   +       determine the preferred state of the "Continue adding keywords"
   +       checkbox. By default it is enabled.
   +     </tal:comment>
   +     <input type="checkbox" id="continue_new_keyword"
   +           name="__redirect_to"
   +           tal:attributes="value

   +     <label for="continue_new_keyword" i18n:translate="">Continue adding keywords.</label>
   +   </td>
      </tr>

Note remove the leading '+' when adding this to the templates.

The key component here is support for the '__redirect_to' query
property. It is a url which can be used when creating any new item
(issue, user, keyword ....). It controls the next page displayed after
creating the item. If '__redirect_to' is not set, then you end up on
the page for the newly created item. The url value assigned to
__redirect_to must start with the tracker's base url and must be properly
url encoded.

Helper popups trigger change events on the original page
--------------------------------------------------------

The helper popups used to set dates (from a calendar), change lists of
users or lists of issues did not notify the browser that the fields
had been changed. This release adds code to trigger the change event.

To add the change event to the calendar popup, you don't need to do
any changes to the tracker. It is all done in the roundup python code
in templating.py.

To add the change event when updating users using the help-submit
template, copy
share/roundup/templates/devel/html/_generic.help-submit.html and
replace your tracker's html/_generic.help-submit.html.  If you have
done local changes to this file, change your file to include the code
that defines the onclick event for the input field with
id="btn_apply".

To add the change event when updating lists of issues copy
share/roundup/templates/devel/html/help_controls.js to your tracer's
html directory. If you have made local changes to the javascript file,
merge the two if/else blocks labeled::

   /* trigger change event on the field we changed */

into your help_controls.js

html/_generic.404.html in trackers use page template
----------------------------------------------------

The original generic 404 error pages for many trackers did not use the
standard page layout. This change replaces the html/_generic.404.html
page with one that uses the page template.

If your deployed tracker is based on: classic, minimal, responsive or
devel templates and has not changed the html/_generic.404.html file,
you can copy in the new file to get this additional functionality.

Organize templates into subdirectories
--------------------------------------

The @template parameter to the web interface allows the use of
subdirectories. So a setting of @template=view/view for an issue would
use the template in the tracker's html/view/issue.view.html. Similarly
for a caller class, you could put all the templates under the
html/caller directory with names like: html/caller/caller.item.html,
html/caller/caller.index.html etc. You may want to symbolically link the
html/_generic* templates into your subdirectory so that missing
templates (e.g. a missing caller.edit.html template) can be satisfied
by the _generic.edit.html template.

Properly quote query dispname (displayed name) in page.html
-----------------------------------------------------------

A new method has been added to HTMLStringProperty called url_quote.
The default templates have been updated to use this in the "Your
Query" section of the trackers html/page.html file. You will want to
change your template. Lines starting with - are the original line and
you want to change it to match the line starting with the + (remove
the + from the line):

.. code::
  :class: big-code

      <tal:block tal:repeat="qs request/user/queries">
  -    <a href="#" tal:attributes="href string:${qs/klass}?${qs/url}&@dispname=${qs/name}"
  +    <a href="#" tal:attributes="href string:${qs/klass}?${qs/url}&@dispname=${qs/name/url_quote}"
          tal:content="qs/name">link</a><br>
      </tal:block>

Find the tal:repeat line that loops over all queries. Then
change the value assigned to @dispname in the href attribute from
${qs/name} to ${qs/name/url_quote}. Note that you should *not* change
the value for tal:content.

Allow "Show Unassigned" issues link to work for Anonymous user
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this release the anonymous user is allowed to search the user
class. The following was added to the schema for all templates that
provide the search option::

   p = db.security.addPermission(name='Search', klass='user')
   db.security.addPermissionToRole ('Anonymous', p)

If you are running a tracker that **does not** allow read access for
anonymous, you should remove this entry as it can be used to perform
a username guessing attack against a roundup install.

Errors and Troubleshooting - Unassigned issues for anonymous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you notice that the "Unassigned Issues" search on page.html
is displaying assigned issues for users with the Anonymous role,
you need to allow search permissions for the user class.

Improvements in Classic Tracker query.edit.html template
--------------------------------------------------------

There is a new query editing template included in the distribution at:

   ``share/roundup/templates/classic/html/query.edit.html``

This template fixes:

 * public query could not be removed from "Your Queries" once it was added.
   Trying to do so would cause a permissions error.
 * private yes/no dropdown always showed "yes" regardless of
   underlying state
 * query Delete button did not work.
 * same query being displayed multiple times

It also adds:
 * the table layout displays queries created by the user first,
   then available public queries.
 * public query owners are shown
 * better support for deleted queries. When a query is deleted, it is
   still available for those who added it to their query list. If you
   are the query owner, you can restore (undelete) the query. If you
   are not the owner you can remove it from your query list.
   (If a query is deleted and nobody had it in their query list, it
   will not show up in the "Active retired queries" section. You will
   have to use the class editor or roundup_admin command line to
   restore it.)
 * notifies the user that delete/restore requires javascript. It
   always did, but that requirement wasn't displayed.

To use the new template, you must add Restore permission on queries to
allow the user to restore queries (see below).

If you have not modified the query.edit.html template in your tracker,
you should be able to copy the new version from the location above.
Otherwise you will have to merge the changes into your modified template.

Add the query Restore permission for the User role to your tracker's
schema.py file.  Place it right after the query retire permission for
the user role. After the change it should look like::

  p = db.security.addPermission(name='Retire', klass='query', check=edit_query,
      description="User is allowed to retire their queries")
  db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)
  p = db.security.addPermission(name='Restore', klass='query',
      check=edit_query,
      description="User is allowed to restore their queries")
  db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

where the last four lines are the ones you need to add.

Usually you can add this to your User role. If all users have the User
role in common then all logged in users should be ok. If you have
users who do not include the User role (e.g. they may only have a
Provisional role), you should add the search permission to that role
(e.g. Provisional) as well if you allow them to edit their list of
queries.

Also see the `new search permissions for query in 1.4.17`_ section
discussing search permission requirements for editing queries. The
fixes in this release require the ability to search the creator of all
queries to work correctly.

If the test script for the `new search permissions for query in
1.4.17`_ doesn't report that a role has the ability to search queries
or at least search the creator property for queries, add the following
permissions to your schema.py::

  s = db.security.addPermission(name='Search', klass='query',
    properties=['creator'],
    description="User is allowed to Search queries for creator")
  db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', s)

Errors and Troubleshooting - Public queries listed twice when editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not do this, public queries will be listed twice in the edit
interface. Once in the "Queries I created" section and again in the
"Queries others created" section of the query edit page
(``http..../query?@template=edit``).

Fix security issues in query.item.html template
-----------------------------------------------
The default query.item.html template allows anybody to view all
queries.

This has been updated in the classic, devel and responsive templates
to only allow people to view queries they creates or queries that are
publicly viewable.

If you haven't modified you query.item.html template, simply copy the
query.item.html template from one of the above default templates to
your tracker's html directory.

Enhancement to check command for Permissions
--------------------------------------------

A new form of check function is permitted in permission definitions.
The three argument form is still supported and will work the same
as it always has (although it may be depricated in the future).

If the check function is defined as::

      check(db, userid, itemid, **ctx)

the ctx variable will have the context to use when determining access
rights::

     ctx['property'] the name of the property being checked or None if
            it's a class check.

     ctx['classname'] the name of the class that is being checked
            (issue, query ....).

     ctx['permission'] the name of the permission (e.g. View, Edit...).

This should make defining complex permissions much easier. Consider::

    def issue_private_access(db, userid, itemid, **ctx):
        if not db.issue.get(itemid, 'private'):
           # allow access to everything if not private
           return True

        # It is a private issue hide nosy list
        # Note that the nosy property *must* be listed
        # in permissions argument to the addPermission
        # definition otherwise this check command
        # is not run.
        if ctx['property'] == 'nosy':
           return False # deny access to this property

        # allow access for editing, viewing etc. of the class
        return True


    e = db.security.addPermission(name='Edit', klass='issue',
                                  check=issue_private_access,
                                  properties=['nosy'],
                                  description="Edit issue checks")

It is suggested that you change your checks to use the ``**ctx``
parameter. This is expected to be the preferred form in the future.
You do not need to use the ``ctx`` parameter in the function if you do
not need it.

Changes to property permissions
-------------------------------

If you create a permission::

    db.security.addPermission(name='View', klass='user',
       properties=['theme'], check=own_record,
       description="User is allowed to view their own theme")

that combines checks and properties, the permission also matches a
permission check for the View permission on the user class.  So this
also allows the user to see their user record. It is unexpected that
checking for access without a property would match this permission.

This release adds support for making a permission like above only be
used during property permission tests. See ``customizing.txt`` and
search for props_only and set_props_only_default in the section
'Adding a new Permission'

Improve query editing
---------------------

If a user creates a query with the same name as one of their existing
queries, the query editing interface will now report an error. By
default the query editing page (issue.search.html) displays the index
page when the search is triggered. This is usually correct since the
user expects to see the results of the query. But now that
the code properly checks for duplicate search names, the user should
stay on the search page if there is an error. To add this to your
existing issue.search.html page, add the following line after the
hidden field ``@old-queryname``::

  <input type="hidden" name="@template" value="index|search"/>

With this addition, the index template is displayed if there is no
error, and the user stays on the search template if there is an error.

New -L (loghttpvialogger) option to roundup-server
--------------------------------------------------

Http request logs from roundup-server are sent to stderr or
can be recorded in a log file (if -l or the logfile options
is used). However there is no way to rotate the logfile
without shutting down and restarting the roundup-server.

If the -L flag is used, the python logging module is used
for logging the http requests. The name for the log
(qualname) is 'roundup.http'. You can direct these messages
to a rotating log file by putting the following::

   [loggers]
   keys=roundup.http

   [logger_roundup.http]
   level=INFO
   handlers=rotate_weblog
   qualname=roundup.http
   propagate=0

   [handlers]
   keys=rotate_weblog

   [handler_rotate_weblog]
   class=logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
   args=('httpd.log','a', 512000, 2)
   formatter=plain

   [formatters]
   keys=plain

   [formatter_plain]
   format=%(message)s

into a file (e.g. logging.ini). Then reference this file in
the 'config' value of the [logging] section in the trackers
config.ini file.

Note the log configuration above is an example and can be
merged into a more full featured logging config file for
your tracker if you wish. It will create a new file in the
current working directory called 'httpd.log' and will rotate
the log file at 500K and keep two old copies of the file.

.. index:: Upgrading; 1.5.0 to 1.5.1

Migrating from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1
=============================

User data visibility
--------------------

For security reasons you should change the permissions on the user
class. We previously shipped a configuration that allowed users to see
too many of other users details, including hashed passwords under
certain circumstances. In schema.py in your tracker, replace the line::

   db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', 'View', 'user')

with::

   p = db.security.addPermission(name='View', klass='user',
       properties=('id', 'organisation', 'phone', 'realname',
       'timezone', 'username'))
   db.security.addPermissionToRole('User', p)

Note that this removes visibility of user emails, if you want emails to
be visible you can add 'address' and 'alternate_addresses' to the list
above.

XSS protection for custom actions
---------------------------------

If you have defined your own cgi actions in your tracker instance
(e.g. in a custom ``extensions/spambayes.py`` file) you need to modify
all cases where client.error_message or client.ok_message are modified
directly. Instead of::

  self.client.ok_message.append(...)

you need to call::

  self.client.add_ok_message(...)

and the same for::

  self.client.error_message.append(...)

vs.::

  self.client.add_error_message(...)

The new calls escape the passed string by default and avoid XSS security
issues.
