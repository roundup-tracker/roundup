I'm proud to release version 1.4.1 of Roundup.

The metakit backend has been removed due to lack of maintenance and
presence of good alternatives (in particular sqlite built into Python 2.5)

Release 1.4.1 removes an old trace of the metakit backend that was
preventing new tracker installation.

New Features in 1.4.0:

- Roundup has a new xmlrpc frontend that gives access to a tracker using
  XMLRPC.
- Dates can now be in the year-range 1-9999
- Add simple anti-spam recipe to docs
- Allow customisation of regular expressions used in email parsing, thanks
  Bruno Damour
- Italian translation by Marco Ghidinelli
- Multilinks take any iterable
- config option: specify port and local hostname for SMTP connections
- Tracker index templating (i.e. when roundup_server is serving multiple
  trackers) (sf bug 1058020)
- config option: Limit nosy attachments based on size (Philipp Gortan)
- roundup_server supports SSL via pyopenssl
- templatable 404 not found messages (sf bug 1403287)
- Unauthorized email includes a link to the registration page for
  the tracker
- config options: control whether author info/email is included in email
  sent by roundup
- support for receiving OpenPGP MIME messages (signed or encrypted)

There's also a ton of bugfixes.

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.3 or later for correct operation.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
