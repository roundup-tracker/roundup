I'm proud to release version 1.5.1 of Roundup which has been possible
due to the help of several contributors.  This release contains
important security enhancements, so make sure to read
`doc/upgrading.txt <http://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html>`_
to bring your tracker up to date. Other changes, as usual, include some
new features and many bug fixes.


Features:

- The example local_replace.py has been updated to show how to link to
  modern revision systems using hex revision identifiers.
  This extension is used to expand shortcuts in msgs. (Bernhard Reiter)
- Drop comment in user settings about numeric hour offsets instead of using
  pytz timezone names. Due to DST these are wrong half of the year, it is
  much better to use timezone names. (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- issue2550793: Wrap messages with very long lines in the web interface.
  (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- New Link / Multilink option "try_id_parsing": Sometimes the key of a
  class can be numeric -- in that case roundup will try to parse the
  value as an ID when evaluating form values -- not as a key. Specifying
  try_id_parsing='no' for these Link/Multilink will skip the ID step,
  default is 'yes'. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- New configuration option 'isolation_level' in rdbms section. Currently
  supported for Postgres and mysql, sets the transaction isolation level.
  Wrong history entries for concurrent database updates observed in
  issue2550806 can be prevented by setting this to 'repeatable read' if
  you want to pay the performance penalty. We test this behaviour in the
  regression tests for Postgres but not currently for mysql.
  See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/transaction-iso.html
  (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- /xmlrpc endpoint now shows link to XML-RPC documentation if accessed
  through browser, without text/xml Content-Type (anatoly techtonik)
- docs: New dedicated chapter for extensions in ``doc/customizing.txt``
  (anatoly techtonik)
- Increase default height of classhelp windows from 400 to 600.
  (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- Date properties now can specify (on input) an explicit timezone suffix
  (similar to RFC 2822), e.g. +0200 for CEST or -0500 for EST. This also
  works in the XMLRPC interface. For examples see roundup.date.Date.
  (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Add RejectRaw exception to allow unescaped HTML error messages to be
  displayed to the user (thanks Ezio Melotti for the initial patch)
  (John Kristensen)

Fixed:

- issue2550869 Duplicate mail headers (Reply-To, Message-ID, In-Reply-To) 
  when sending out email. Reported with first fix by Mathias Behrle.
  (Bernhard Reiter)
- issue2550830 An empty LinkHTMLProperty cannot be compared successfully. 
  Improves the query editing page. Reported and fixed by R David Murray 
  (Bernhard Reiter).
- Fix Release-date of 1.5.0 in this file (thanks to Bernhard for
  discovery) (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Pythons cgi form code can return a TypeError, we now guard for this
  condition. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Small bug-fix in SQL backends: A query (e.g. in a html menu) with a
  where-clause that always evaluates to false now will not raise a
  traceback. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Remove Python 2.3 compatibility code for i18n (anatoly techtonik)
- If documentation 'sphinx-build' tool is not found in system PATH,
  'setup.py build_doc' command now tries to detect it from PYTHONPATH
  (anatoly techtonik)
- Read version and release for generated documentation from
  roundup/__init__.py. (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- Do not throw an internal error if a .mo file can not be read
  (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- issue2550673 Make the "Make a copy" link work by fixing copy_url to properly
  handle multilink properties. (John Rouillard)
- issue2550583, issue2550635 Do not limit results with Xapian indexer
  (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- Allow using plain() on unsaved dates in HTML forms
  (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- setup.py now installs static files of the HTML documentation (stylesheets,
  images, etc.) (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- executable .py scripts need "#!/usr/bin/env python", add this to demo.py,
  remove exec bits from website/wiki/wiki/data/plugin/theme/roundup.py
  (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- issue2550822: Fix showing more than one additional property in class menu.
  Report and fix by James Mack (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- Fix String search with special SQL wildcard characters in LIKE/ILIKE
  clause and add testcase (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Fix subtle bug when sorting by a Link that contains a Multilink from
  which we also search for an attribute. In that case the LEFT OUTER
  JOIN clause was missing in generated SQL. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Fix another XSS issue2550817. Note that the code that triggers that
  particular bug is no longer in roundup core. But the change to the
  templates we suggest is a *lot* safer as it by default escapes the
  error and ok messages now. Thanks to Thibault Fevry for the original
  bug-report. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- issue2117897: Fixed two more places in date.py where seconds can be
  rounded to 60.0 and causing exceptions. Change them to 59.999 as was
  done in the fix for issue2550802. (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- Fix batch.propchanged for transitive id properties (would result in a
  backtrace when trying to group by property.id) (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Fix issue2550835, the test checks for date-range queries with an
  interval that depends on the local time. Put the queried date a little
  later to avoid a race condition where the queried interval doesn't
  match the date because the clock has advanced. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Apply german translation fixes from Debian team in issue2550761,
  thanks to Kai Storbeck for taking the time to report these.
  (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Fix issue2550843 Pass text of Unauthorised and Login exceptions instead
  of the exception instance to avoid traceback with string operations.
  (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- Fix issue2550841 roundup-demo templates not found in virtualenv (John
  Kristensen)
- Security: Default user permissions should not include all user
  attributes. We now limit this to the username, realname and some
  further attributes depending on the schema. Note that we no longer
  include the email addresses, depending on your installation you may
  want to further restrict this or add some attributes like ``address``
  and ``alternate_addresses``. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Correctly recreate the database directory when re-initialising a tracker
  instance. (John Kristensen)
- In case of an error, date fields would lose the calendar help, fixed.
  (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- demo.py usage message improved: explains "nuke" now. (Bernhard Reiter)
- Fix issue2550735 Missing doc for xmlrpc schema. Thanks to Cédric Krier
  for the patch. (anatoly techtonik)
- Fix two line-break accidents in devel and responsive milestone.item.html
  (Thomas Arendsen Hein)
- Fix broken images in legacy spec.html and original_overview.html, and
  restore web presence for "Roundup's Design Document" (anatoly techtonik)
- Template jinja2: Updated URL to point to http://www.roundup-tracker.org/,
  fixed a typo. (Bernhard Reiter)
- Security: Add mime-type whitelist for attachmens that can be safely
  rendered from Roundup without trigerring security bugs in browser
  plugins, XSS issues and spam. The option ``allow_html_file`` didn't
  provide protection for invalid content-type, in which case browser
  tried to guess the best one. Thanks to Kay Hayen for reporting and
  helping debug this. issue2550848 (Ralf Schlatterbeck, anatoly techtonik)
- Documentation: configuration messages_to_author value "nosy" now documented
  in chapter "customizing". (Bernhard Reiter)
- issue2550877 Failures in test_mailgw.py because of duplicated headers
  and more precise comparision. Writing headers with the email module will use 
  continuation_ws = ' ' now for python 2.5 and 2.6. (Bernhard Reiter)
- issue2550870 migrate use of 'rfc822' module to the 'email' module
  (Bernhard Reiter/John Kristensen)
- Doctests for roundup.date.Date are now really executable and don't
  fail. Bug-Fixes in range properties, open intervals with 'to' didn't
  always work. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- issue2550881 demo.py: Add pointer how to access demo from remote host.
  Suggested by Karl-Philipp Richter. (Bernhard Reiter)
- issue2550884 roundup-mailgw --help text improved to explain the allowed 
  parameters better. Suggested by by Karl-Philipp Richter. (Bernhard Reiter)
- Fix form-parsing: If multiple new items are added to a multilink
  property, the old version would create the new items but only link
  one. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- issue2550892 (translation error of priority in locale de) Thanks 
  Martin Thomas Swaton for reporting. (Bernhard Reiter)
- Help-Window now gets focus, this prevents the case that help doesn't
  work because an old help-window is below the main window.
  (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- issue2550811 20% fix: jinja2 template engine now has an example 
  how to use non-ascii unicode contents with a custom filter ('|u').

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.5+ (but not 3+)
installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
though an install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
