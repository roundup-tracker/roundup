I'm pleased to announce Roundup 0.6.7, a maintenance release which fixes
some bugs (most notably making the EMAIL_CHARSET config variable backwards-
compatible):

- be more backward-compatible when asking for EMAIL_CHARSET
- made error on create consistent with edit when user enters invalid data
  for Multilink and Link form fields (sf bug 904072)
- made errors from bad input in the quick "Show issue:" form more
  user-friendly (sf bug 904064)
- don't add a query to a user's list if it's already there
- nicer invalid property error in HTML templating
- use EMAIL_CHARSET for message body too (still sf bug 900046)

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Note that the Zope interface still doesn't work - it is fixed in the 0.7
development codebase.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation. Python 2.3.1
or later is strongly recommended.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

    python demo.py

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning
design from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design
competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by
managing discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are
edited. One of the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to
get going. Roundup is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python
2.1+ installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be
operational, though a disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker
and a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3,
sqlite, metakit and mysql).
