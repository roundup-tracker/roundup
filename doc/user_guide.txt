Note: this document will refer to *issues* as the primary store of information
in the tracker. This is the default of the classic template, bubt may vary in
any given installation.

Your Tracker in a Nutshell
==========================

Your tracker holds information about issues in bundles we call *items*. An
item may be an *issue* (a bug or feature request) or a *user*. The issue-ness or
user-ness is called the item's *class*. So, for bug reports and features, the
class is "issue", and for users the class is "user".

Each item in the tracker has an id number that identifies it along with its
item class. To identify a particular issue or user, we combine the class with
the number to create a unique label, so that user 1 (who, incidentally, is
*always* the "admin" user) is referred to as "user1".  Issue number 315 is
referred to as "issue315". We call that label the item's *designator*.

Accessing the Tracker
---------------------

You may access your tracker through one of three ways:

1. through the `web interface`_,
2. through the `e-mail gateway`_, or
3. using the `command line tool`_.

The last is usually only used by administrators. Most users will use the web
and email interfaces. All three are explained below.


Entering values in your Tracker
-------------------------------

All interfaces to your tracker use the same format for entering values. This
means the web interface for entering a new issue, the web interface for
searching issues, the email interface and even the command-line administration
tool.


String and Numeric properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These fields just take a simple text value, like ``It's broken``.


Boolean properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These fields take a value which indicates "yes"/"no", "true"/"false",
"1"/"0" or "on"/"off".


Constrained (link and multilink) properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields like "Assigned To" and "Topics" hold references to items in other
classes ("user" and "keyword" in those two cases.)

Sometimes, the selection is done through a menu, like in the "Assigned To"
field.

Where the input is not a simple menu selection, we use a comma-separated
list of values to indicated which values of "user" or "keyword" are
interesting. The values may be either numeric ids or the
names of items. The special value "-1" may be used to match items where the
property is not set. For example, the following searches on the issues:

``assignedto=richard,george``
  match issues which are assigned to richard or george.
``assignedto=-1``
  match issues that are not assigned to a user.
``assignedto=2,3,40``
  match issues that are assigned to users 2, 3 or 40.
``topic=user interface``
  match issues with the keyword "user interface" in their topic list
``topic=web interface,email interface``
  match issues with the keyword "web interface" or "email interface" in
  their topic list
``topic=-1``
  match issues with no topics set


Date properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some fields in the search page (e.g. "Activity" or "Creation date") hold
dates.  A plain date entered as a search field will match that date exactly
in the database.  We may also accept ranges of dates. You can specify range
of dates in one of two formats:

1. English syntax::

    [[From] <value>][ To <value>]

   Keywords "From" and "To" are case insensitive. Keyword "From" is optional.

2. "Geek" syntax::

    [<value>][; <value>]

Either first or second ``<value>`` can be omitted in both syntaxes.

For example, if you enter string "from 9:00" to "Creation date" field,
roundup will find  all issues, that were created today since 9 AM.

Searching of "-2m; -1m" on activity field gives you issues which were
active between period of time since 2 months up-till month ago.

Other possible examples (consider local time is Sat Mar  8 22:07:48 2003)::

	>>> Range("from 2-12 to 4-2")
	<Range from 2003-02-12.00:00:00 to 2003-04-02.00:00:00>
	
	>>> Range("18:00 TO +2m")
	<Range from 2003-03-08.18:00:00 to 2003-05-08.20:07:48>
	
	>>> Range("12:00")
	<Range from 2003-03-08.12:00:00 to None>
	
	>>> Range("tO +3d")
	<Range from None to 2003-03-11.20:07:48>
	
	>>> Range("2002-11-10; 2002-12-12")
	<Range from 2002-11-10.00:00:00 to 2002-12-12.00:00:00>

	>>> Range("; 20:00 +1d")
	<Range from None to 2003-03-09.20:00:00>


Interval properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

XXX explain...

When searching on interval properties use the same syntax as for dates.


Web Interface
=============

Note: this document contains screenshots of the default look and feel. Your
site may have a slightly (or very) different look, but the functionality will
be very similar, and the concepts still hold.

The web interface is broken up into the following parts:

1. `lists of items`_,
2. `display, edit or entry of an item`_, and
3. `searching page`_.


Lists of Items
--------------

The first thing you'll see when you log into Roundup will be a list of open
(ie. not resolved) issues. This list has been generated by a bunch of controls
`under the covers`_ but for now, you can see something like:

.. img: images/index_logged_out.png

The screen is divided up into three sections:

.. img: images/page_layout.png

you may either register or log in. Registration takes you to:

.. img: images/registration.png

Once you're logged in, the screen changes slightly to:

.. img: images/index_logged_in.png

Note that the sidebar menu has changed slightly, so you can now get to your
"My Details" page:

.. img: images/my_details.png

Note the new information on this page - the history.


Display, edit or entry of an item
---------------------------------

Create a new issue with "create new" under the issue subheading. This will
take you to:

.. img: images/new_issue.png

The `nosy list`_ is explained below.
Enter some information and click "submit new entry" and you'll be rewarded
with:

.. img: images/new_issue_created.png

or, if you don't enter all the required information (or some other error
occurs) you'll get something like:

.. img: images/new_issue_error.png


Searching Page
--------------

See `entering values in your tracker`_ for an explanation of what you may 
type into the search form.



Under the covers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The searching page converts your selections into the following arguments:

========== =============================================================
Argument   Description
========== =============================================================
:sort      sort by prop name, optionally preceeded with '-'
           to give descending or nothing for ascending sorting.
:group     group by prop name, optionally preceeded with '-' or
           to sort in descending or nothing for ascending order.
:filter    selects which props should be displayed in the filter
           section. Default is all.           
:columns   selects the columns that should be displayed.
           Default is all.                     
propname   selects the values the item properties given by propname
           must have (very basic search/filter).
========== =============================================================

You may manually write URLS that contain these arguments, like so (whitespace
has been added for clarity)::

    /issue?status=unread,in-progress,resolved&
        topic=security,ui&
        :group=priority&
        :sort=-activity&
        :filters=status,topic&
        :columns=title,status,fixer


Access Controls
---------------

User access is controlled through Permissions. These are are grouped into
Roles, and users have a comma-separated list of Roles assigned to them.

Permissions divide access controls up into answering questions like:

- may the user edit issues ("Edit", "issue")
- is the user allowed to use the web interface ("Web Access")
- may the user edit other user's Roles through the web ("Web Roles")

Any number of new Permissions and Roles may be created as described in the
customisation documentation. Examples of new access controls are:

- only managers may sign off issues as complete
- don't give users who register through email web access
- let some users edit the details of all users


E-Mail Gateway
==============

E-mail sent to Roundup is examined for several pieces of information:

1. `subject-line information`_ identifying the purpose of the e-mail
2. `e-mail message content`_ which is to be extracted
3. e-mail attachments which should be associated with the message

Subject-line information
------------------------

The subject line of the incoming message is examined to find one of:

1. the item that the message is responding to,
2. the type of item the message should create, or
3. we default the item class and try some trickiness

If the subject line contains a prefix in ``[square brackets]`` then we're
looking at case 1 or 2 above. Note that any "re:" or "fwd:" prefixes are
stripped off the subject line before we start looking for real information.

If an item designator (class name and id number, for example ``issue123``)
is found there, a new "msg" item is added to the "messages" property for
that item, and any new "file" items are added to the "files" property for
the item.

If just an item class name is found there, we attempt to create a new item of
that class with its "messages" property initialized to contain the new "msg"
item and its "files" property initialized to contain any new "file" items.

The third case above - where no ``[information]`` is provided, the tracker's
``MAIL_DEFAULT_CLASS`` configuration variable defines what class of item
the message relates to. We try to match the subject line to an existing
item of the default class, and if there's a match, the message is related to
that matched item. If not, then a new item of the default class is created.

Setting Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The e-mail interface also provides a simple way to set properties on items. At
the end of the subject line, propname=value pairs can be specified in square
brackets, using the same conventions as for the roundup set shell command.

For example,

- setting the priority of an issue::

   Subject: Re: [issue1] the coffee machine is broken! [priority=urgent]

- adding yourself to a nosy list::

   Subject: Re: [issue2] we're out of widgets [nosy=+richard]

- setting the nosy list to just you and cliff::

   Subject: Re: [issue2] we're out of widgets [nosy=richard,cliff]

- removing yourself from a nosy list and setting the priority::

   Subject: Re: [issue2] we're out of widgets [nosy=-richard;priority=bug]

In all cases, the message relates to issue 2. The ``Re:`` prefix is stripped
off.


Automatic Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**status of new issues**
 When a new message is received that is not identified as being related to an
 existing issue, it creates a new issue. The status of the new issue is
 defaulted to "unread".

**reopening of resolved issues**
 When a message is is received for a resolved issue, the issue status is
 automatically reset to "chatting" to indicate new information has been
 received.


E-Mail Message Content
----------------------

Roundup only associates plain text (MIME type ``text/plain``) as messages for
items. Any other parts of a message are associated as downloadable files. If
no plain text part is found, the message is rejected.

To do this, incoming messages are examined for multiple parts:

* In a multipart/mixed message or part, each subpart is extracted and
  examined. The text/plain subparts are assembled to form the textual body
  of the message, to be stored in the file associated with a "msg" class
  item. Any parts of other types are each stored in separate files and
  given "file" class items that are linked to the "msg" item.
* In a multipart/alternative message or part, we look for a text/plain
  subpart and ignore the other parts.

If the message is a response to a previous message, and contains quoted
sections, then these will be stripped out of the message if the
``EMAIL_KEEP_QUOTED_TEXT`` configuration variable is set to ``'no'``.

Message summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "summary" property on message items is taken from the first non-quoting
section in the message body. The message body is divided into sections by blank
lines. Sections where the second and all subsequent lines begin with a ">" or
"|" character are considered "quoting sections". The first line of the first
non-quoting section becomes the summary of the message.


Address handling
----------------

All of the addresses in the ``To:`` and ``Cc:`` headers of the incoming
message are
looked up among the tracker users, and the corresponding users are placed
in the
"recipients" property on the new "msg" item. The address in the ``From:`` header
similarly determines the "author" property of the new "msg" item. The default
handling for addresses that don't have corresponding users is to create new
users with no passwords and a username equal to the address.

The addresses mentioned in the ``To:``, ``From:`` and ``Cc:`` headers of
the message may be added to the `nosy list`_ depending on:

``ADD_AUTHOR_TO_NOSY``
 Does the author of a message get placed on the nosy list automatically?
 If 'new' is used, then the author will only be added when a message
 creates a new issue. If 'yes', then the author will be added on followups
 too. If 'no', they're never added to the nosy.

``ADD_RECIPIENTS_TO_NOSY``
 Do the recipients (To:, Cc:) of a message get placed on the nosy list?
 If 'new' is used, then the recipients will only be added when a message
 creates a new issue. If 'yes', then the recipients will be added on
 followups too. If 'no', they're never added to the nosy.


Nosy List
~~~~~~~~~

Roundup watches for additions to the "messages" property of items.

When a new message is added, it is sent to all the users
on the "nosy" list for the item that are not already on the "recipients" list
of the message. Those users are then appended to the "recipients" property on
the message, so multiple copies of a message are never sent to the same user.
The journal recorded by the hyperdatabase on the "recipients" property then
provides a log of when the message was sent to whom.

If the author of the message is also in the nosy list for the item that the
message is attached to, then the config var ``MESSAGES_TO_AUTHOR`` is queried
to determine if they get a nosy list copy of the message too.


Mail gateway script command line
--------------------------------

The roundup mail gateway may be called in one of three ways:

 . with an instance home as the only argument,
 . with both an instance home and a mail spool file, or
 . with both an instance home and a pop server account.
 
It also supports optional -C and -S arguments that allows you to set a
fields for a class created by the roundup-mailgw. The default class if
not specified is msg, but the other classes: issue, file, user can
also be used. The -S or --set options uses the same
property=value[;property=value] notation accepted by the command line
roundup command or the commands that can be given on the Subject line
of an email message.

It can let you set the type of the message on a per email address basis.

PIPE:
 In the first case, the mail gateway reads a single message from the
 standard input and submits the message to the roundup.mailgw module.

UNIX mailbox:
 In the second case, the gateway reads all messages from the mail spool
 file and submits each in turn to the roundup.mailgw module. The file is
 emptied once all messages have been successfully handled. The file is
 specified as::

   mailbox /path/to/mailbox

POP:
 In the third case, the gateway reads all messages from the POP server
 specified and submits each in turn to the roundup.mailgw module. The
 server is specified as::

    pop username:password@server

 The username and password may be omitted::

    pop username@server
    pop server

 are both valid. The username and/or password will be prompted for if
 not supplied on the command-line.

APOP:
 Same as POP, but using Authenticated POP::

    apop username:password@server


Command Line Tool
=================

The basic usage is::

 Usage: roundup-admin [options] [<command> <arguments>]

 Options:
  -i instance home  -- specify the issue tracker "home directory" to administer
  -u                -- the user[:password] to use for commands
  -d                -- print full designators not just class id numbers
  -c                -- when outputting lists of data, comma-separate them.
		       Same as '-S ","'.
  -S <string>       -- when outputting lists of data, string-separate them
  -s                -- when outputting lists of data, space-separate them.
		       Same as '-S " "'.

  Only one of -s, -c or -S can be specified.

 Help:
  roundup-admin -h
  roundup-admin help                       -- this help
  roundup-admin help <command>             -- command-specific help
  roundup-admin help all                   -- all available help

 Commands: 
  commit
  create classname property=value ...
  display designator[,designator]*
  export [class[,class]] export_dir
  find classname propname=value ...
  get property designator[,designator]*
  help topic
  history designator
  import import_dir
  initialise [adminpw]
  install [template [backend [admin password]]]
  list classname [property]
  pack period | date
  reindex
  retire designator[,designator]*
  rollback
  security [Role name]
  set items property=value property=value ...
  specification classname
  table classname [property[,property]*]
 Commands may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation matches only one
 command, e.g. l == li == lis == list.


All commands (except help) require a tracker specifier. This is just the
path to the roundup tracker you're working with. A roundup tracker is where
roundup keeps the database and configuration file that defines an issue
tracker. It may be thought of as the issue tracker's "home directory".
It may be specified in the environment variable ``TRACKER_HOME`` or on
the command line as "``-i tracker``".

A designator is a classname and an itemid concatenated, eg. bug1, user10, ...
Property values are represented as strings in command arguments and in the
printed results:

- Strings are, well, strings.
- Password values will display as their encoded value.
- Date values are printed in the full date format in the local time zone,
  and accepted in the full format or any of the partial formats explained
  below.::
  
    Input of...        Means...
    "2000-04-17.03:45" 2000-04-17.08:45:00
    "2000-04-17"       2000-04-17.00:00:00
    "01-25"            yyyy-01-25.00:00:00
    "08-13.22:13"      yyyy-08-14.03:13:00
    "11-07.09:32:43"   yyyy-11-07.14:32:43
    "14:25"            yyyy-mm-dd.19:25:00
    "8:47:11"          yyyy-mm-dd.13:47:11
    "."                "right now"
    
- Link values are printed as item designators. When given as an argument,
  item designators and key strings are both accepted.
- Multilink values are printed as lists of item designators joined by
  commas. When given as an argument, item designators and key strings are
  both accepted; an empty string, a single item, or a list of items joined
  by commas is accepted.
  
When multiple items are specified to the roundup get or roundup set
commands, the specified properties are retrieved or set on all the listed
items.  When multiple results are returned by the roundup get or roundup
find commands, they are printed one per line (default) or joined by commas
(with the "``-c``" option).

Where the command changes data, a login name/password is required. The login may
be specified as either "``name``" or "``name:password``".

- ``ROUNDUP_LOGIN`` environment variable
- the "``-u``" command-line option

If either the name or password is not supplied, they are obtained from the
command-line.

Using with the shell
--------------------

With version 0.6.0 or newer of roundup which supports: multiple
designators to display and the -d, -S and -s flags.

To find all messages regarding chatting issues that
contain the word "spam", for example, you could execute the
following command from the directory where the database
dumps its files::

    shell% for issue in `roundup-admin -ds find issue status=chatting`; do
    > grep -l spam `roundup-admin -ds ' ' get messages $issue`
    > done
    msg23
    msg49
    msg50
    msg61
    shell%

Or, using the -dc option, this can be written as a single command::

    shell% grep -l spam `roundup get messages \
        \`roundup -dc find issue status=chatting\``
    msg23
    msg49
    msg50
    msg61
    shell%

You can also display issue contents::

    shell% roundup-admin display `roundup-admin -dc get messages \
               issue3,issue1`
    files: []
    inreplyto: None
    recipients: []
    author: 1
    date: 2003-02-16.21:23:03
    messageid: None
    summary: jkdskldjf
    files: []
    inreplyto: None
    recipients: []
    author: 1
    date: 2003-02-15.01:59:11
    messageid: None
    summary: jlkfjadsf    
    
or status::

    shell% roundup-admin get name `/tools/roundup/bin/roundup-admin \
	      -dc -i /var/roundup/sysadmin get status issue3,issue1`
    unread
    deferred

or status on a single line::

    shell% echo `roundup-admin get name \`/tools/roundup/bin/roundup-admin \
             -dc -i /var/roundup/sysadmin get status issue3,issue1\``
    unread deferred

which is the same as::

    shell% roundup-admin -s get name `/tools/roundup/bin/roundup-admin \
             -dc -i /var/roundup/sysadmin get status issue3,issue1`
    unread deferred

Also the tautological::

   shell% roundup-admin get name \
	  `roundup-admin -dc get status \`roundup-admin -dc find issue \
          status=chatting\``
   chatting
   chatting

Remember the roundup commands that accept multiple designators accept
them ',' separated so using '-dc' is almost always required.
