==================
Developing Roundup
==================

.. note::
   The intended audience of this document is the developers of the core
   Roundup code. If you just wish to alter some behavior of your Roundup
   installation, see `Customising Roundup`_.

Getting Started
---------------

If you are looking for a good first issue, search for `StarterTicket
on https://issues.roundup-tracker.org`_. These include issues where
Python development, documentation or web design skills are useful.

You can continue the conversation using the issue or join the
Roundup-devel list to get assistance and verify your planned changes.

All development is coordinated through two resources:

- roundup-devel mailing list at
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/roundup/lists/roundup-devel
- The issue tracker running at
  https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/

In addition, the Roundup IRC channel on irc.oftc.net can be accessed
via the web interface shown on the Contact page. The channel is logged
and the web sites for the logs are shown in the channel topic. You can
ask questions and use it to coordinate work discussed using the
resources above.

Anyone wishing to help in the development of the Roundup Python core
may find `Roundup's Design Document`_ and the `implementation notes`_
helpful.

People working on Documentation or designing changes to the Web
interface don't need to get into the implementation internals.

Project Rules
-------------

Be polite to others. There is no place for ad hominem attacks.

Mostly the project follows Guido's Python Style (though naming tends
to be a little relaxed sometimes). In short:

- 80 column width code
- 4-space indentations

Other project rules:

- new functionality must be documented, even briefly (so at
  least we know where there's missing documentation) and
  changes to tracker configuration must be logged in the
  upgrading document.
- discuss any changes with the other developers on
  roundup-dev. If nothing else, this makes sure there's no
  rude shocks.
- write unit tests for changes you make (where possible),
  and ensure that all unit tests run before committing
  changes.
- run flake8_ or pylint_ over changed code.
- if you have direct commit access to the repository,
  subscribe to roundup-checkins to receive checkin
  notifications from the other developers with write access
  to the source-code repository.

The goal is to have no flake8 issues. Current code has
complex functions, some long lines and use of mutable
objects in function signatures. Some third party code
(e.g. ZPT) vendored into the codebase has more issues.

The administrators of the project reserve the right to boot
developers who consistently check in code which is either
broken or takes the codebase in directions that have not
been agreed to.

Setting up a Development Environment
------------------------------------

Roundup doesn't require any external libraries. Installing
Python 3 and its core libraries is enough to get Roundup
running.

The easiest way to work with Roundup is to clone the
repository.  Roundup is developed using the `Mercurial
distributed version control system (DVCS)`_ [1]_. It is
`hosted at Sourceforge`_. See
https://www.roundup-tracker.org/code.html for details.

If you are used to git, Mercurial's `command equivalence
table`_ can help. Most of the concepts from git (except for
staging) should be familiar.

To clone the repository use::

   hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/roundup/code roundup

(Yes, that is an http url.) 

This will create a read only clone (you can't ``hg push``)
of the repo. Changes you make can be attached as patches
(created using ``hg diff``) to tickets in our `issue
tracker`_.

See https://www.roundup-tracker.org/code.html for URL's and
directions on getting read write access which allows pushing
to the repository.

Once you have your clone, you can run ``python3 ./demo -b
sqlite`` and get a working Roundup server. This will start
the server using the ``sqlite`` backend. The code is in the
``roundup`` subdirectory.

To test internationalization in your environment, you have to
process the locale sub-directory into a form that roundup's
i18n code will recognize. To do this use:

  make -C locale local_install

which will compile the ``.po`` source files into binary
``.mo`` files and install them under
``locale/locale/<LANGUAGE_CODE>/LC_MESSAGES/roundup.mo``. For
German this will be
``locale/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/roundup.mo``. 

By default this requires ``msgfmt`` from the the GNU gettext tools
installed on your system. If you do not have ``msgfmt`` installed, you
can use:

  make -C locale local_install MSGFMT="python3 ../roundup/msgfmt.py"

Also to compile a single .po file, you can invoke ``python
roundup/msgfmt.py po_file mo_file`` to compile your .po file to a .mo
file. It's slow but seems to work in basic tests. The msgfmt.py file
is used by Roundup to compile out of date .po files.

Submitting Changes
------------------

Most small changes can be submitted as patches through the
`issue tracker`_ or sent to `Roundup-devel mailing list`_.

Your account on sourceforge can be set up to allow direct
pushes to the repo. Once that is done, using::

   hg push https://user@hg.code.sf.net/p/roundup/code

or 

   hg push ssh://user@hg.code.sf.net/p/roundup/code

will commit your changes.


Other Resources - CI, Code Coverage 
-----------------------------------

Roundup has a `copy of the mercurial repository on GitHub`_. It is
updated manually after every few commits to the Mercurial
repository. Updates trigger the CI pipeline which happens on two
services:

  1. `GitHub Actions`_. It runs Docker container scans using Anchore as
     well as security scans for dependencies using CodeQL. Also it
     runs the test suite on multiple versions of Python.
  2. `TravisCI`_ is also used to run CI. It runs the test suite on
     multiple Python versions. It also provides alpha and development
     Python releases faster than GitHub.

GitHub actions upload coverage statistics to both `CodeCov`_ and
`Coveralls`_. TravisCI only uploads to CodeCov.

We run our own issue tracker so we can dogfood the code. As
a result, we do not use GitHub issues. Pull requests are
grudgingly accepted. They have to be exported and applied to
the Mercurial repository. This is time consuming so patches
attached to an issue in our tracker are preferred.

Debugging Aids
--------------

Try turning on logging of DEBUG level messages. This may be done a number
of ways, depending on what it is you're testing:

1. If you're testing the database unit tests, then set the environment
   variable ``LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG``. This may be done like so:

    LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG python -m pytest test/

   This variable replaces the older HYPERDBDEBUG environment var.

2. If you're testing a particular tracker, then set the logging level in
   your tracker's ``config.ini``.

If you set the environment variable SENDMAILDEBUG to a filename,
roundup will write each email message that it sends to that file
instead to the internet.  This environment variable is independent of
the python -O flag.

Documentation Notes
-------------------

All docs are written using sphinx. Use pip or your package manager to
install sphinx. In addition you will need to install a couple of
sphinx extensions to process the files. A requirement's file can be
found in docs/requirement.pip or website/www/requirements.pip. You can
install these requirements using ``python -m pip install -r
<path_to_requirements_file>``.

The extensions sphinx-sitemap generates a sitemap when building for
the website. The sphinx-tabs extension generates tabs for displaying
code examples in both TAL and Jinja2.

To build the documentation distributed with a Roundup release, run
``python setup.py build_doc`` at the root of the source tree. To build
docs for the website, see the ``updating www.roundup-tracker.org``
section of ``website/README.txt`` or TL;DR ``cd website/www; make
html``.

Testing Notes
-------------

Create tests for your changes. Also run the tests in reverse to try to
identify test dependencies. You can do this by creating a
``conftest.py`` in the top of the source tree and include the
following contents::

   def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items): 
       items.reverse()

to run all the tests in reverse. More tips at: https://testmon.org/blog/hidden-test-dependencies/.

The full test suite can take a while to run. The `pytest-testmon
<https://pypi.org/project/pytest-testmon/>`_ package can be installed
with pip. It analyzes changes to code and run tests that test that
code. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to run a basic
test suite. Use it by running::

  python3 -m pytest -v --testmon test

once over the whole test suite. Then subsequent calls will analyze the
changed files/functions and run tests that cover those changes.

To run some tests (test_liveserver.py, test_indexer.py, ...) you need
to have some additional modules installed. These include:

  * requests
  * mock
  
If you are working with a docker container that is set up to execute
Python application and not for development, you will need to install
pytest.

Internationalization Notes
--------------------------

How stuff works:

1. Strings that may require translation (messages in human language)
   are marked in the source code.  This step is discussed in
   `Marking Strings for Translation`_ section.

2. These strings are all extracted into Message Template File
   ``locale/roundup.pot`` (_`POT` file).  See `Extracting Translatable
   Messages`_ below.

3. Language teams use POT file to make Message Files for national
   languages (_`PO` files).  All PO files for Roundup are kept in
   the ``locale`` directory.  Names of these files are target
   locale names, usually just 2-letter language codes.  `Translating
   Messages`_ section of this chapter gives useful hints for
   message translators.

4. Translated Message Files are compiled into binary form (_`MO` files)
   and stored in ``locale`` directory (but not kept in the source code
   repository, as they may be easily made from PO files).
   See `Compiling Message Catalogs`_ section.

5. Roundup installer creates runtime locale structure on the file
   system, putting MO files in their appropriate places.

6. Runtime internationalization (_`I18N`) services use these MO files
   to translate program messages into language selected by current
   Roundup user.  Roundup command line interface uses locale name
   set in OS environment variable ``LANGUAGE``, ``LC_ALL``,
   ``LC_MESSAGES``, or ``LANG`` (in that order).  Roundup Web User
   Interface uses language selected by currently authenticated user.

Additional details may be found in `GNU gettext`_ and Python `gettext
module`_ documentation. Additional information on ``.po`` translation
files can also be found at pology_.

`Roundup source distribution`_ includes POT and PO files for message
translators, and also pre-built MO files to facilitate installations
from source.  Roundup binary distribution includes MO files only.

.. _GNU gettext:

GNU gettext package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This chapter is full of references to GNU `gettext package`_.
GNU gettext is a "must have" for nearly all steps of internationalizing
any program, and it's manual is definitely a recommended reading
for people involved in `I18N`_.

There are GNU gettext ports to all major OS platforms.
Windows binaries are available from `GNU mirror sites`_.

Roundup does not use GNU gettext at runtime, but it's tools
are used for `extracting translatable messages`_, `compiling
message catalogs`_ and, optionally, for `translating messages`_.

Note that ``gettext`` package in some OS distributions means just
runtime tools and libraries.  In such cases gettext development tools
are usually distributed in separate package named ``gettext-devel``.

Marking Strings for Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Strings that need translation must be marked in the source code.
Following subsections explain how this is done in different cases.

If translatable string is used as a format string, it is recommended
to always use *named* format specifiers::

  _('Index of %(classname)s') % locals()

This helps translators to better understand the context of the
message and, with Python formatting, remove format specifier altogether
(which is sometimes useful, especially in singular cases of `Plural Forms`_).

When there is more than one format specifier in the translatable
format string, named format specifiers **must** be used almost always,
because translation may require different order of items.

It is better to *not* mark for translation strings that are not
locale-dependent, as this makes it more difficult to keep track
of translation completeness.  For example, string ``</ol></body></html>``
(in ``index()`` method of the request handler in ``roundup_server``
script) has no human readable parts at all, and needs no translations.
Such strings are left untranslated in PO files, and are reported
as such by PO status checkers (e.g. ``msgfmt --statistics``).

Hints for the translator can be added by adding a comment block
starting with ``# .Hint``. The hints will be extracted into the .pot
file and merged to the .po files used by the translators. This can add
context to how the string is used. For example from admin.py::

  # .Hint read as: assignedto was admin(1)
  # where assignedto is the property
  # admin is the key name for value 1
  _("%(prop)s was %(name)s(%(value)s)")

is shown in the .po file as::

  #. .Hint read as: assignedto was admin(1)
  #. where assignedto is the property
  #. admin is the key name for value 1
  #: ../roundup/admin.py:1091
  #, python-format
  msgid "%(prop)s was %(name)s(%(value)s)"
  msgstr ""

allowing the translator to see the replaced string so they can
understand how name and value are used.

Command Line Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scripts and routines run from the command line use "static" language
defined by environment variables recognized by ``gettext`` module
from Python library (``LANGUAGE``, ``LC_ALL``, ``LC_MESSAGES``, and
``LANG``).  Primarily, these are ``roundup-admin`` script and
``admin.py`` module, but also help texts and startup error messages
in other scripts and their supporting modules.

For these interfaces, Python ``gettext`` engine must be initialized
to use Roundup message catalogs.  This is normally done by including
the following line in the module imports::

  from i18n import _, ngettext

Simple translations are automatically marked by calls to builtin
message translation function ``_()``::

  print(_("This message is translated"))

Translations for messages whose grammatical depends on a number
must be done by ``ngettext()`` function::

  print(ngettext("Nuked %i file", "Nuked %i files", number_of_files_nuked))

Deferred Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes translatable strings appear in the source code in untranslated
form [#note_admin.py]_ and must be translated elsewhere.
Example::

  for meal in ("spam", "egg", "bacon"):
      print(_(meal))

In such cases, strings must be marked for translation without actual
call to the translating function.  To mark these strings, we use Python
feature of automatic concatenation of adjacent strings and different
types of string quotes::

  strings_to_translate = (
      ''"This string will be translated",
      ""'me too',
      ''r"\raw string",
      ''"""
      multiline string"""
  )

.. [#note_admin.py] In current Roundup sources, this feature is
   extensively used in the ``admin`` module using method docstrings
   as help messages.

Web User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Web User Interface, translation services are provided by Client
object.  Action classes have methods ``_()`` and ``gettext()``,
delegating translation to the Client instance.  In HTML templates,
translator object is available as context variable ``i18n``.

HTML templates have special markup for translatable strings.
The syntax for this markup is discussed at `ZPTInternationalization`_.
(Originally documented at
http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/ZPTInternationalizationSupport
which is now gone.)
Roundup translation service currently ignores values for
``i18n:domain``, ``i18n:source`` and ``i18n:target``.

Template markup examples:

* simplest case::

    <div i18n:translate="">
     Say
     no
     more!
    </div>

  this will result in msgid ``"Say no more!"``, with all leading and
  trailing whitespace stripped, and inner blanks replaced with single
  space character.

* using variable slots::

    <div i18n:translate="">
     And now...<br/>
     No.<span tal:replace="number" i18n:name="slideNo" /><br/>
     THE LARCH
    </div>

  Msgid will be: ``"And now...<br /> No.${slideNo}<br /> THE LARCH"``.
  Template rendering will use context variable ``number`` (you may use
  any expression) to put instead of ``${slideNo}`` in translation.

* attribute translation::

    <button name="btn_wink" value=" Wink " i18n:attributes="value" />

  will translate the caption (and return value) for the "wink" button.

* explicit msgids.  Sometimes it may be useful to specify msgid
  for the element translation explicitly, like this::

    <span i18n:translate="know what i mean?">this text is ignored</span>

  When rendered, element contents will be replaced by translation
  of the string specified in ``i18n:translate`` attribute.

* ``i18n`` in `TALES`_.  You may translate strings in `TALES`_ python
  expressions::

    <span tal:replace="python: i18n.gettext('Oh, wicked.')" />

* plural forms.  There is no markup for plural forms in `TAL`_ i18n.
  You must use python expression for that::

    <span tal:replace="python: i18n.ngettext(
      'Oh but it\'s only %i shilling.',
      'Oh but it\'s only %i shillings.',
      fine) % fine"
    />

Detectors and extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The correct ``i18n`` objects gets automatically injected in the hyperdb.
In a detector you can access the i18n object and do translation like
this::

  def statusfail(db, cl, nodeid, newvalues):
    _ = db.i18n.gettext
    raise ValueError(_("this does not work"))

  def init(db):
    # fire before changes are made
    db.status.audit('create', statusfail)

.. index::
     i18n; adding translations for your tracker
     see: internatonalization; i18n
     see: localization; i18n

Extracting Translatable Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most common tool for message extraction is ``xgettext`` utility
from `GNU gettext package`_.  Unfortunately, this utility has no means
of `Deferred Translations`_ in Python sources.  There is ``xpot`` tool
from Francois Pinard free `PO utilities`_ that allows to mark strings
for deferred translations, but it does not handle `plural forms`_.

Roundup overcomes these limitations by using both of these utilities.
This means that you need both `GNU gettext`_ tools and `PO utilities`_
to build the Message Template File yourself.

Latest Message Template File is kept in the source code repository 
and distributed with `Roundup Source`_.  
If you wish to rebuild the template yourself,
make sure that you have both ``xpot`` and ``xgettext`` installed and
just run ``gmake`` (or ``make``, if you are on a `GNU`_ system like
`linux`_ or `cygwin`_) in the ``locale`` directory.

For on-site i18n, Roundup provides command-line utility::

  roundup-gettext <tracker_home>

extracting translatable messages from tracker's html templates.
This utility creates message template file ``messages.pot`` in
``locale`` subdirectory of the tracker home directory.  Translated
messages may be put in *locale*.po files (where *locale* is selected
locale name) in the same directory, e.g.: ``locale/ru.po``.
These message catalogs are searched prior to system-wide translations
kept in the ``share`` directory.

If you are creating your own ``.po`` file from scratch rather than
using ``roundup-gettext``, you must have the minimal preamble
specifying the format of the file. This::

  msgid ""
  msgstr ""
  "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"

should be present as the first translatable string in your .po file.
If you use ``roundup-gettext`` it will add a full preamble including
``Content-Type``. If the preamble is missing, using characters outside
of the ASCII range will cause Roundup to crash with a
UnicodeDecodeError.

Translating Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gettext Message File (`PO`_ file) is a plain text file, that can be created
by simple copying ``roundup.pot`` to new .po file, like this::

  $ cp roundup.pot ru.po

The name of PO file is target locale name, usually just 2-letter language
code (``ru`` for Russian in the above example).  Alternatively, PO file
may be initialized by ``msginit`` utility from `GNU gettext`_ tools::

  $ msginit -i roundup.pot

``msginit`` will check your current locale, and initialize the header
entry, setting language name, rules for `plural forms`_ and, if available,
translator's name and email address.  The name for PO file is also chosen
based on current locale.

Next, you will need to edit this file, filling all ``msgstr`` lines with
translations of the above ``msgid`` entries.  PO file is a plain text
file that can be edited with any text editor.  However, there are several
tools that may help you with this process:

 - `poEdit`_ by Vaclav Slavik.  Very nice cross-platform GUI editor.

 - `Lokalize`_. A replacement for KBabel. Being part of `KDE`_, it
    works in X windows only. Haven't had much experience with it, though.

 - ``po-mode`` for `emacs`_.  One of `GNU gettext`_ tools.  Very handy,
   definitely recommended if you are comfortable with emacs.  Cannot
   handle `plural forms`_ per se, but allows to edit them in simple
   text mode.

 - `po filetype plugin`_ for `vim`_.  Does not do as much as ``po-mode``,
   but helps in finding untranslated and fuzzy strings, and checking
   code references.  Please contact `alexander smishlajev`_ if you
   prefer this, as i have patched this plugin a bit.  I have also
   informed the original plugin author about these changes, but got
   no reply so far.

Additional information on ``.po`` files can be found at pology_.

Compiling Message Catalogs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message catalogs (`PO`_ files) must be compiled into binary form
(`MO`_ files) before they can be used in the application.  This
compilation is handled by ``msgfmt`` utility from `GNU gettext`_
tools.  ``GNUmakefile`` in the ``locale`` directory automatically
compiles all existing message catalogs after updating them from
Roundup source files.  If you wish to rebuild an individual `MO`_
file without making everything else, you may, for example::

  $ msgfmt --statistics -o ru.mo ru.po

This way, message translators can check their `PO`_ files without
extracting strings from source.  (Note: String extraction requires
additional utility that is not part of `GNU gettext`_.  See `Extracting
Translatable Messages`_.)

At run time, Roundup automatically compiles message catalogs whenever
`PO`_ file is changed.

.. [1] Roundup is written in Python and we believe in using tools in
   the Python ecosystem whenever possible.
