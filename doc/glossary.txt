   :sorted:

   class
      a definition of the properties and behavior of a set of items

   classname
      the name of a class. It must start with a letter, end with a letter
      or "_", and only have alphanumerics and "_" in the middle.

   db
      database used to store the data in the tracker. Roundup supports
      4 databases: dbm (Berkeley DB/BDB), SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB.

   definitional class
      a class that exists to define a discrete set of values. For example
      status or priority.

   designator
      a combined :term:`classname` + :term:`itemid` reference to any item
      in the hyperdb. E.g. ``issue26``. Note that form values can include
      something that looks like a designator composed of a classname,
      a dash '-', and a number. E.g. ``file-1``. These are used to create
      new instances of a class via the web interface.

   html directory
      there is a directory called **html** in tracker homes. This
      contains html files (called templates) that are processed by the
      templating processor (TAL or jinja2) for delivery to a web
      client. However there is also a ``templates`` setting in the
      tracker's ``config.ini`` file. The default value for this is
      ``html``. However any directories listed as templates should be
      considered an ``html directory``

   hyperdb
      a software layer between the user and the underlying :term:`db`.
      It is responsible for mutating the underlying db when the schema
      changes. It also executes the detectors when items in the db change.

   item
      a collection of data that forms one entry in the hyperdb.

   itemid
      an integer reference to a particular item of one
      class. Internally it is stored as a string and not an integer
      number. This results in a string not numeric sort by id in some
      circumstances.

   property
      one element of data that makes up an item. In Roundup, the set 
      of item properties may be changed as needed - even after the 
      tracker has been initialized and used in production.

   schema
      the definition of all the classes and properties that make up a
      tracker. Contained in the file ``schema.py``. The permissions
      for the schema items are usually defined in the same file.

   tracker
      the schema and hyperdb that forms one issue tracker

   tracker home
      the physical location on disk of a tracker. It has the
      ``config.ini``, ``schema.py`` files for the tracker.
