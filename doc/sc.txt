     Original documentation of the Roundup Issue tracker. Includes
     historic Software Carpentry submissions and a short paper.

===================================
Software Carpentry and Short Papers
===================================

These papers are the original artifacts of Roundup.  They can't be
included easily in the table of contents for the documentation, so
they are referenced here.  All of these were written by Ka-Ping Yee,
the original architect of Roundup..

A few of the pages have been updated to correct links. However you may
still have to use the `wayback machine <https://web.archive.org>`_
to access some of the links on these pages. The papers in
chronological order are:

  * `A short paper explaining Roundup <roundup_short_paper.html>`_

  * `The original overview document for Roundup submitted to the
    Software Carpentry competition <original_overview.html>`_

  * `The original specification document for Roundup submitted to the
    Software Carpentry competition <spec.html>`_
