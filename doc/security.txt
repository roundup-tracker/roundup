Roundup Security Issues
=======================

This page documents how to report security issues and verify the
signatures for Roundup releases.

Reporting Security Issues
-------------------------
Security issues with Roundup should be reported by email to:

   rouilj@users.sourceforge.net  (John Rouillard)

   rsc@runtux.com (Ralf Schlatterbeck)

If these fail, you can find rouilj on irc in channel #roundup at
irc.oftc.net (see Contact_ for more directions and web
interface). Methods listed at Contact_ are all public, so they should
be used to contact somebody with the Roundup project for establishing
a proper method of reporting the security issue.

.. _Contact: https://www.roundup-tracker.org/contact.html

Verify Source Tarball
---------------------

.. index::
   single: Distribution, verify with gpg
   single: Signature, verify

If you download the source tarball using ``python3 -m pip download
roundup`` or from https://pypi.org/project/roundup/#files you can
verify the file using gpg.

This is the information on the public PGP/GPG key used to sign Roundup
distributions.  It is used to sign the 1.6.0, 2.2.0, and newer
releases. (Note that the @ sign in email addresses have been replaced
with the word "at" to reduce spam directed at the mailing list.)::

  Key info: Roundup Team (signing key for roundup releases)
      <roundup-devel at lists.sourceforge.net>
  Expires: 2028-07-17
  Key fingerprint = 411E 354B 5D1A F261 25D6  2122 1F2D D0CB 756A 76D8

Releases 1.6.1, 2.0.0 and 2.1.0 were accidentally signed with this key
[1]_::

  Key info: John Rouillard (Roundup Release Key)
      <rouilj+roundup at ieee.org>
  Expires: 2023-07-09
  Key fingerprint =  A1E6 364E 9429 E9D8 2B3B 2373 DB05 ADC4 2330 5876

.. [1] Use gpg to import this key from the keyserver pgp.mit.edu
       if you need to verify one of these releases. Use the gpg
       pgp.mit.edu keyserver example replacing the key fingerprint
       with the one starting A1E6.

Importing the Public Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This only has to be added to your keyring once. You can import a key
from pgp.mit.edu using::

   gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --receive-keys 411E354B5D1AF26125D621221F2DD0CB756A76D8

where the fingerprint (without spaces) is used to identify which key
to receive. You can also extract and import the file
``tools/roundup.public.pgp.key`` from the download source tarball
using::

  tar -xzvf roundup-2.2.0.tar.gz -O \
     roundup-2.2.0/tools/roundup.public.pgp.key > pub.key

  gpg --import pub.key

Once you have loaded the public key, you need a detached signature for
your release.


Download and Verify with Detached Signature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This needs to be done once for each release you wish to verify.

The Python Package Index (PyPI) used to support uploading gpg detached
signatures. However that is no longer supported and downloading
existing signatures may not work in the future.

As a result, the signatures for all Roundup final releases starting
with 1.6.0 have been moved and are linked below:

.. rst-class:: multicol

* `2.3.0 <../signatures/roundup-2.3.0.tar.gz.asc>`_
* `2.3.0b2 <../signatures/roundup-2.3.0b2.tar.gz.asc>`_
* `2.2.0 <../signatures/roundup-2.2.0.tar.gz.asc>`_
* `2.1.0 <../signatures/roundup-2.1.0.tar.gz.asc>`_
* `2.0.0 <../signatures/roundup-2.0.0.tar.gz.asc>`_
* `1.6.1 <../signatures/roundup-1.6.1.tar.gz.asc>`_
* `1.6.0 <../signatures/roundup-1.6.0.tar.gz.asc>`_

To use the signature, download the correct versioned link and verify
it with (note 1.5.7 is a dummy version, use the correct version
number)::

  gpg --verify roundup-1.5.7.tar.gz.asc roundup-1.5.7.tar.gz

You should see::

  gpg: Signature made Wed 13 Jul 2022 12:24:14 AM EDT
  gpg:                using RSA key 411E354B5D1AF26125D621221F2DD0CB756A76D8
  gpg: Good signature from "Roundup Team (signing key for roundup releases) <roundup-devel at lists.sourceforge.net>" [unknown]
  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
  Primary key fingerprint: 411E 354B 5D1A F261 25D6  2122 1F2D D0CB 756A 76D8

which verifies the tarball integrity. The WARNING is expected and the
date corresponds to the newest renewal of the Roundup key. As long as
you see the output starting with "Good signature from" followed by the
Key Info for your key, everything is OK.

If something is wrong you will see::

  gpg: Signature made Wed 13 Jul 2022 12:24:14 AM EDT
  gpg:                using RSA key 411E354B5D1AF26125D621221F2DD0CB756A76D8
  gpg: BAD signature from "Roundup Team (signing key for roundup releases) <roundup-devel at lists.sourceforge.net>"

**do not use** the tarball if the signature is BAD. Email the
roundup-devel mailing list if you have this happen to you.
