Roundup Tracker Templates
=========================

The templates distributed with Roundup are stored in the "share" directory
nominated by Python. On Unix this is typically
``/usr/share/roundup/templates/`` (or ``/usr/local/share...``) and
on Windows this is ``c:\python27\share\roundup\templates\``.

The template loading looks in four places to find the templates:

1. *share* - eg. ``<prefix>/share/roundup/templates/*``.
   This should be the standard place to find them when Roundup is
   installed running setup.py from source.
2. ``install_dir``/../<prefix>/share/....``, where prefix is the
   Python's ``sys.prefix``. ``sys.base_prefix`` or 
   `sys.base_prefix/local``. This finds templates (and locales)
   installed by pip. E.G. in a virtualenv located at (``sys.prefix``):
   ``/tools/roundup``, roundup would be at:
   ``/tools/roundup/lib/python3.6/site-packages/roundup``. The
   templates would be at:
   ``/tools/roundup/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tools/roundup/share/roundup/templates/``.
3. ``<roundup.admin.__file__>/../../share/roundup/templates/*``.
   This will be used if Roundup's run in the distro (aka. source)
   directory.
4. ``<current working dir>/*``.
   This is for when someone unpacks a 3rd-party template.
5. ``<current working dir>``.
   This is for someone who "cd"s to the 3rd-party template dir.

Templates contain:

- modules ``schema.py`` and ``initial_data.py``
- directories ``html``, ``detectors`` and ``extensions``
  (with appropriate contents)
- optional directory ``lib`` which contains modules used by the other
  tracker components
- optional ``config_ini.ini`` file. It is structured like a tracker's
  ``config.ini`` but contains only headers (e.g. ``[main]``) and
  *required* parameters that are different from defaults. For example::
  
    [main]
    template_engine = jinja2

    static_files = static

  These settings override the default values in the tracker's
  ``config.ini`` when using roundup-admin to install a template.
- template "marker" file ``TEMPLATE-INFO.txt``, which contains
  the name of the template, a description of the template
  and its intended audience.

  An example TEMPLATE-INFO.txt:

  .. code-block:: text

     Name: classic
     Description: This is a generic issue tracker that may be used to
		  track bugs, feature requests, project issues or any
		  number of other types of issues. Most users of
		  Roundup will find that this template suits them,
		  with perhaps a few customisations.
     Intended-For: All first-time Roundup users
