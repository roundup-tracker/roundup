Overview
========

A Roundup installation is made up of several pieces.

Roundup scripts
 These include the Roundup HTTP server, email gateway, administration
 command-line interface, demo installer etc. These are usually placed
 in a directory that is on your path.

Roundup core code
 Is installed into your Python's lib directory. We recommend
 using a virtual environment for your Roundup installation.

Roundup trackers
 Trackers consist of issues (be they bug reports or otherwise). Each tracker
 is put in its own directory (called a tracker home) and has its own:

 * configuration files,
 * HTML (web) files,
 * database,
 * logic files (detectors, schema, ...)

 Roundup trackers are initialised with a "template" which defines the
 fields usable/assignable on a per-issue basis.  Descriptions of the
 provided templates are given in `choosing your template`_. Usually
 you start with a template then modify the tracker to implement your
 desired workflow. One Roundup instalation can support multiple
 trackers with different look/feel and workflow.

For The Really Impatient
========================

If you just want to give Roundup a whirl **Right Now**, follow these
directions to run ``demo.py``. Demo mode starts the `classic tracker`_
without installing Roundup on your system.  If you have Docker
installed, you can run `demo mode using docker`_ instead.

This is also a way to spin up a development environment or even
deploy a tracker for a handful of users.

You can choose different templates and backend databases using demo
mode. For example replacing ``demo.py`` (or ``demo`` if you are using
docker) with::

   demo jinja2 anydbm

will start the tracker using the jinja2 template with the dbm database
backend (rather then the default sqlite). See `Choosing Your
Template`_ for a description of available templates.

(In the directions below, replace ``-2.2.0`` with the version number
of the file you downloaded. On systems that don't have a ``python3``
program you can run ``python demo.py`` instead.)

.. _install the source:

1. ``python3 -m pip download roundup``
2. ``tar -xzvf roundup-2.2.0.tar.gz``

   * if you don't have a tar command, ``python3 -c "import tarfile, sys; tarfile.open(sys.argv[1]).extractall();" roundup-2.2.0.tar.gz`` can be used.

3. ``cd roundup-2.2.0``
4. ``python3 demo.py``

This will set up a classic demo tracker on your machine without
installing Roundup. [1]_ When it's done, it'll print out a URL for
your web browser at so you can explore a Roundup tracker. Three users
are set up:

1. anonymous - the "default" user with permission to do very little
2. demo (password "demo") - a normal user who may create issues
3. admin (password "admin") - an administrative user who has complete
   access to the tracker

Note the demo tracker removes the detector (nosyreaction.py) that
sends email notifications. If you later convert your demo tracker to
production you will need to replace the detector to send notification
emails.

Once you install Roundup, you can use the ``roundup-demo`` command to
install new demo trackers.

.. [1] Demo tracker is set up to be accessed by localhost browser.
       If you run demo on a server host, please stop the demo (using
       Control-C) after it has shown the startup notice, open file
       ``demo/config.ini`` with your editor, change host name in
       the ``web`` option in section ``[tracker]``, save the file,
       then re-run the demo.py program.

.. _demo mode using docker:

Running in Demo Mode with Docker
--------------------------------

You can either:

* use a published container from hub.docker.com with
  ``rounduptracker/roundup:latest``

and start demo mode with::

    docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8917:8080 --name roundup_demo -v \
       $PWD:/usr/src/app/tracker rounduptracker/roundup:latest demo

or

* Use steps 1-3 to `install the source`_ then

* build a local docker container using::

     docker build -t roundup-app -f scripts/Docker/Dockerfile .

  (see `Docker Support`_ and `Building a Docker Container`_ for more
  details)

and start demo mode with::

    docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8917:8080 --name roundup_demo -v \
       $PWD:/usr/src/app/tracker roundup-app:latest demo

This will create a ``demo`` subdirectory which is your tracker's
home. It will also print the URL for exploring your new tracker.

.. caution::
  Removing ``127.0.0.1:`` will make the tracker accessible from any
  host with network access to your system. However the URL's created by
  Roundup will still reference ``localhost`` unless you modify the
  ``web`` url in the ``tracker`` section of ``config.ini`` and restart
  the container [1]_.

In the docker run command we used port 8917 for Roundup. When starting
Roundup, Docker may report a long error ending with: `bind: address
already in use.` This means that port 8917 is in use.  When running
inside a Docker container, demo mode is unable to automatically find a
free port. You have to provide an unused port to ``-p``.

To fix this, you can change the change the port mapping provided
with ``-p``. If you do this you **must** set the docker PORT_8080
environment variable on the command line to match. (If Docker
ever fixes https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/3778 we won't need
to worry about this.)

For example::

    docker run --rm -e PORT_8080=9090 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:8080 -v \
       --name roundup_demo $PWD:/usr/src/app/tracker \
       rounduptracker/roundup:latest demo

will run Roundup on port 9090 and Roundup will generate the correct
URL.

To shut down the tracker and get your shell back, use control-c. You
can remove the tracker using ``rm -f`` on the ``demo`` directory.

Prerequisites
=============

Roundup requires Python 2.7 [3]_ or 3.6 or newer with a functioning anydbm
or sqlite module. The version installed by most vendors should work if
it meets the version requirements. If necessary, you can download the
latest version from https://www.python.org/. It is highly recommended
that users install the latest patch version of Python as these contain
many fixes to serious bugs.

Some variants of Linux will need an additional '``python-dev``' package
installed for Roundup installation to work. Debian and derivatives, are
known to require this.

Optional Components
===================

You may optionally install and use:

An RDBMS
  Sqlite, MySQL and Postgresql are all supported by Roundup and will be
  used if available. One of these is recommended if you are anticipating a
  large user base (see `choosing your backend`_ below). Sqlite should
  always be available.

Timezone Definitions
  Full timezone support requires pytz_ module (version 2005i or later)
  which brings the `Olson tz database`_ into Python.  If pytz_ is not
  installed, timezones may be specified as numeric hour offsets only.
  This is optional but strongly suggested.

Xapian full-text indexer
  The Xapian_ full-text indexer is also supported and will be used by
  default if it is available. This is strongly recommended if you are
  anticipating a large number of issues (> 5000).

  You may install Xapian at any time, even after a tracker has been
  installed and used. You will need to run the "roundup-admin reindex"
  command if the tracker has existing data.

  Roundup requires Xapian 1.0.0 or newer.

  Note that capitalization is not preserved by the Xapian search.
  This is required to make the porter stemmer work so that searching
  for ``silent`` also returns documents with the word ``silently``.
  Note that the current stemming implementation is designed for English.

Whoosh full-text indexer
  The Whoosh_ full-text indexer is also supported and will be used by
  default if it is available (and Xapian is not installed). This is
  recommended if you are anticipating a large number of issues (> 5000).
  It is also the only search backend that implements fuzzy search. It
  matches any word that has a 1 character difference from the search term.

  You may install Whoosh at any time, even after a tracker has been
  installed and used. You will need to run the "roundup-admin reindex"
  command if the tracker has existing data.

  Roundup was tested with Whoosh 2.5.7, but earlier versions in the
  2.0 series may work. Whoosh is a pure Python indexer so it is slower
  than Xapian, but should be useful for moderately sized trackers.
  It uses the StandardAnalyzer which is suited for Western languages.

pyopenssl
  If pyopenssl_ is installed the roundup-server can be configured
  to serve trackers over SSL. If you are going to serve roundup via
  proxy through a server with SSL support (e.g. apache) then this is
  unnecessary.

gpg
  If gpg_ is installed you can configure the mail gateway to perform
  verification or decryption of incoming OpenPGP MIME messages. When
  configured, you can require email to be cryptographically signed
  before roundup will allow it to make modifications to issues.

jinja2
  To use the jinja2 template (may still be experimental, check out
  its TEMPLATE-INFO.txt file) you need
  to have the jinja2_ template engine installed.

.. _install/docutils:

docutils
  To use ReStructuredText rendering you need to have the `docutils`_
  package installed.

.. _install/markdown:

markdown, markdown2 or mistune
  To use markdown rendering (as supplied by the jinja2 template)
  you need to have the markdown_,
  markdown2_ (2.4.9 known to be broken, 2.3.3, 2.4.10+ known to
  work), or mistune_ (v0.8.4 tested; python3 only) package installed.

zstd, brotli
  To have roundup compress the returned data using one of these
  algorithms, you can install one or more of zstd_ or brotli_.
  Roundup's responses can always be compressed with gzip from the
  Python standard library. Also nginx and various wsgi server can
  compress the response from Roundup as they transmit/proxy it to the
  client.

redis
  Storing ephemeral data: session keys, CSRF tokens etc. can be 
  performance bottleneck. You can choose to deploy a Redis_ database
  using the redis-py_ pypi package. See the section on
  `Using Redis for Session Databases`_ in the `administration
  guide`_ for details.

pyjwt
  To use JWT (JSON web tokens) for login (experimental), install `pyjwt`_
  (v1.7.1, v2.0.1 tested). If you don't have it installed, JWT's
  are not supported.

pywin32 - Windows Service
  You can run Roundup as a Windows service if pywin32_ is installed.
  Otherwise it must be started manually.

pyreadline3
  When running roundup-admin on windows, installing pyreadline3_ will
  allow history and editing on the command line.

requests
  If you are using OAuth authentication with the roundup-mailgw
  mail gateway you must install the requests_ library.

.. _Using Redis for Session Databases:
   admin_guide.html#using-redis-for-session-databases

.. [3] Do not use Python 2 for new installs. The continuous
       integration and other services used for developing Roundup
       are dropping support for Python 2. Also optional packages
       are dropping Python 2 support. As a result Python 2 may
       not be supported for many more release cycles.

Installing Roundup
==================

To get a production installation running will take 15-30 minutes.  If
you want to spend less than 5 minutes to test Roundup without
installing it, see `For The Really Impatient`_.

.. note:: Some systems, such as Gentoo and NetBSD, already have
    Roundup installed. Try running the command "roundup-admin
    -v".  If it runs and reports the current version, you may
    skip the `Standard installation`_ below and go straight to
    `configuring your first tracker`_. However it may be an old
    version. If so you should probably install it in a virtual
    environment from the Roundup web site or pypi.

If Roundup is not installed on your system, or needs to be updated,
there are multiple ways to install Roundup.

* `Standard installation`_ using pip in a Virtual Environment is the
  recommended standard.
* `Installing from downloaded source`_ allows more control over how
  things are installed (including overwriting a vendor install). But
  it also increases complexity as well.
* Use a prebuilt docker container from
  ``rounduptracker/roundup:latest``  and follow the steps in
  `Running Your Container`_.
* Install in a docker container by downloading the source
  and following the steps in `Docker Support`_.

There are several steps to get Roundup serving a tracker:

1. Install using one of the methods listed above.
2. Configure your tracker following `configuring your first tracker`_
   for all install methods.
3. Optionally `configure a web interface`_.
4. Optionally `configure an email interface`_.
5. Follow `UNIX environment steps`_ to restrict local access to
   Roundup if you're installing on a shared UNIX system.

For information about what Roundup installs, see the
`What does Roundup install`_ section in the `administration guide`_.


Standard Installation
----------------------

Installation of Roundup using Python3 in a virtual environment is
recommended. Use::

   python3 -m venv /path/to/environment/roundup

Activate the Python environment (assuming a Bourne like shell)
using::

   . /path/to/environment/roundup/bin/activate

To install the released Roundup core code into your Python tree and
Roundup scripts into ``/path/to/environment/roundup/usr/bin`` run::

    python3 -m pip install roundup

If everything went well, you should now be able to run::

  roundup-admin help

and see the help text.

If you want to run Roundup commands in the future without
activating the virtual environment, just call the commands using the
full path. For example::

  /path/to/environment/roundup/usr/bin/roundup-admin

You can use the command ``deactivate`` to return to the normal
Python environment. However, for now continue with
`configuring your first tracker`_.
   
.. _downloaded and unpacked the source:

Installing from downloaded source
---------------------------------

In general you should be installing from a released Roundup version
into a virtual environment.

.. _current development version: ../code.html

If you are installing a `current development version`_ or are a
developer or are an expert you can use the manual installation method
from a source install. From the unpacked source distribution, run::

    sudo python3 setup.py install

which will put the Roundup core code into your systems Python tree and 
the command scripts into ``/usr/bin``

If you would like to place the Roundup scripts in a directory other
than ``/usr/bin``, then specify the preferred location with
``--install-scripts``. For example, to install them in
``/opt/roundup/bin``::

    sudo python setup.py install --install-scripts=/opt/roundup/bin

You can also use the ``--prefix`` option to install roundup into a
completely different base directory.  If you choose to do this, you
will have to change Python's search path (sys.path) yourself.

Configuring your first tracker
==============================

Make sure the ``roundup-admin`` script location is on your ``PATH``
evironment variable. This is done automatically when you activate a
virtual environment. You can also specify the full path to the command
in the following steps.

1. To create a Roundup tracker (necessary to do before you can
   use the software in any real fashion), you need to set up a "tracker
   home":

   a. (Optional) If you intend to keep your roundup trackers
      under one top level directory which does not exist yet,
      you should create that directory now.  Example::

         mkdir /opt/roundup/trackers

   .. index:: roundup-admin; install subcommand

   b. Install a new tracker with the command ``roundup-admin install``.
      You will be asked a series of questions.  Descriptions of the provided
      templates can be found in `choosing your template`_ below.  Descriptions
      of the available backends can be found in `choosing your backend`_
      below.  The questions will be something like (you may have more
      templates or backends available)::

          Enter tracker home: /opt/roundup/trackers/support
          Templates: minimal, jinja2, classic, responsive, devel
          Select template [classic]: classic
          Back ends: anydbm, sqlite
          Select backend [anydbm]: anydbm

      Note: "Back ends" selection list depends on availability of
      third-party database modules.  Standard python distribution
      includes anydbm and sqlite module only.

      The "support" part of the tracker home can be anything you want - it
      is the directory where the tracker information will be stored.

      You will now be directed to edit the tracker configuration and
      initial schema.  At a minimum, you must set "tracker :: web"
      (that's the "web" option in the "tracker" section),
      "mail :: host", and "mail :: domain". You should also
      set "main :: admin_email" to your local admin address to get email
      on unusual occurances. If you get stuck,
      and get configuration file errors, then see the `tracker
      configuration`_ section of the `reference documentation`_.

      If you just want to get set up to test things quickly (and follow
      the instructions in step 3 below), you can even just set the
      "tracker :: web" variable to::

         web = http://localhost:8080/support/

      The URL *must* end in a '/', or your web interface *will not work*.
      See the `Roundup reference`_ for details on configuration and schema
      changes. You may change any of the configuration after
      you've initialised the tracker - it's just better to have valid values
      for this stuff now.

   .. index:: roundup-admin; initialise subcommand

   c. Initialise the tracker database with ``roundup-admin initialise``.
      You will need to supply an admin password at this step. You will be
      prompted::

          Admin Password:
                 Confirm:

      Note: running this command will *destroy any existing data in
      the database*. In the case of MySQL and PostgreSQL, any existing
      database (or optionally database schema for PostgreSQL) will be
      dropped and re-created.

      Once this is done, the tracker has been created. See the note in
      the `administration guide`_ on how to :ref:`initialise a
      tracker without being prompted for the password <initpw>` or
      exposing the password on the command line.

2. At this point, your tracker is set up, but doesn't have a nice user
   interface. To set that up, we need to `configure a web interface`_ and
   optionally `configure an email interface`_. If you want to try your
   new tracker out, assuming the ``web`` setting in the
   ``[tracker]`` [4]_  section of config.ini is set to
   ``'http://localhost:8080/support/'``, run::

     roundup-server support=/opt/roundup/trackers/support

   then direct your web browser at:

     http://localhost:8080/support/

   and you should see the tracker interface.

   To run your tracker on some interface other than 127.0.0.1 and port
   8080 (make sure you change the "tracker :: web" option to match) use::

     roundup-server -p 1080 -n 0.0.0.0 support=/opt/roundup/trackers/support

   to run the server at port 1080 and bind to all ip addresses on your system.
   Then direct your web browser to ``http://your_host_name:1080/support/``.

.. [4] The rest of the documentation uses the abbreviated form "tracker ::
       web" for specifying a section and setting.

Choosing Your Template
----------------------

Roundup ships with 5 templates. A description of each follows. When
Roundup is installed, you can also get a description of available
templates using ``roundup-admin templates``. You can use this to view
additional templates that you create or download.

.. _classic tracker:

Classic Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The classic template is the one defined in the `Roundup
Specification`_. It holds issues which have priorities and
statuses. Each issue may also have a set of messages which are
disseminated to the issue's list of nosy users.

Minimal Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimal template has the minimum setup required for a tracker
installation. That is, it has the configuration files, defines a user
database and the basic HTML interface to that. It's a completely clean
slate for you to create your tracker on.

Other Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three other templates distributed with Roundup:

devel
   This is a generic issue tracker that may be used to track bugs,
   feature requests, project issues or any number of other types of
   issues. Most users of Roundup will find that this template suits
   them, with perhaps a few customisations.

responsive
   This issue tracker uses the same schema as devel.  The difference
   between devel and responsive templates is the use of Twitter
   bootstrap (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) in templates and
   HTML5 markup.  Make sure the "static_files" setting in your
   config.ini of your instance is set to the directory where the
   static files live (the subdirectory "static" in the default of the
   template).

jinja2
   This is a generic issue tracker based on classic schema.  It uses
   Jinja2 for templating and Twitter bootstrap for responsive markup.
   You will need jinja and gettext for this to work.  See the wiki
   page https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/Jinja2 for updates
   between releases.

Also other people have listed their trackers for different needs at:
https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/TrackerTemplates.

.. index:: database; choosing your backend

Choosing Your Backend
---------------------

The actual storage of Roundup tracker information is handled by backends.

Roundup supports basic full text search (FTS) for all backends. Some
backends support a faster native FTS. Also Roundup supports using
whoosh or xapian for FTS.

There are several backends to choose from, each with benefits and
limitations:

========== =========== ===== ==============================
Name       Speed       Users Support
========== =========== ===== ==============================
anydbm     Slowest     Few   Always available
sqlite     Fastest     Few   Always available
postgresql Fast        Many  Needs install/admin (psycopg2_)
mysql      Fast        Many  Needs install/admin (MySQLdb_)
========== =========== ===== ==============================

**anydbm**
  This was one of the original database backends. It is a simple
  key/value store and is a prototype implementation for NoSQL
  backends. It also used to be the only backend that was
  guaranteed to be present. These days using SQLite is preferred
  unless you have some reason for preferring a key/value backend
  (e.g. you are interested in adding support for MongoDB or other
  NoSQL persistence layer).
**sqlite**
  This uses the embedded database engine SQLite and the PySQLite_
  driver to provide a very fast
  backend. This is not suitable for trackers which will have many
  simultaneous users, but requires much less installation and maintenance
  effort than more scalable postgresql and mysql backends.

  SQLite is supported via PySQLite version 2.1.0 and sqlite3 (the last
  being bundled with Python 2.5+)

  Installed SQLite should be the latest version available (3.9.0 or newer).

  .. _fts5-testing:

  Installation of Roundup 2.2.0 or newer requires that the installed
  SQLite supports FTS5. This is required even if you are not going to
  use FTS5 for full text searching. FTS5 was included in SQLite
  release 3.9.0 in October 2015. However some vendors choose not to
  include it.  RedHat 7's native sqlite3 is known to not work.

  You can check your SQLite by using the command line::

     echo 'pragma compile_options' | sqlite3 | grep FTS5

  it should output ``ENABLE_FTS5`` if FTS5 is supported.

  You can check using the same version of Python you use for running
  Roundup with::

     import sqlite3

     con = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
     cur = con.cursor()
     cur.execute('pragma compile_options;')
     available_pragmas = cur.fetchall()
     con.close()

  The output should include ``('ENABLE_FTS5',)`` in the output.

  Roundup supports using `SQLite's full text search capability
  <admin_guide.html#sqlite-details>`_. This
  can improve searching if you are not installing another indexer like
  xapian or whoosh. It works best with English text.
**postgresql**
  Backend for popular RDBMS PostgreSQL. You must read
  `doc/postgresql.txt`_ for additional installation steps and
  requirements. You must also configure
  the ``rdbms`` section of your tracker's ``config.ini``.  It is recommended
  that you use at least version 2.8 of psycopg2.

  Roundup supports using `postgresql's full text search
  capability
  <admin_guide.html#postgresql-info>`_. This
  can improve searching if you are not installing another indexer like
  xapian or whoosh. It can be tuned to work with different languages.
**mysql**
  Backend for popular RDBMS MySQL. You must read `doc/mysql.txt`_ for
  additional installation steps and requirements. You must also
  configure the ``rdbms`` section of your tracker's ``config.ini``

You may defer your decision by setting your tracker up with the anydbm
backend (which is guaranteed to be available) and switching to one of the
other backends at any time using the instructions in the `administration
guide`_.

Regardless of which backend you choose, Roundup will attempt to initialise
a new database for you when you run the "``roundup-admin initialise``" command.
In the case of MySQL and PostgreSQL you will need to have the appropriate
privileges to create databases.


Configure a Web Interface
=========================

There are multiple ways to deploy the web interface. If your
tracker will be heavily used and accessible from the internet, we
suggest using Apache or Nginx in WSGI mode or as a reverse proxy
to the stand alone web server or WSGI server like Gunicorn.

A FastCGI deployment with an alternate web server is suitable for
lower traffic sites.

If you already run Zope, Roundup should deploy nicely in that
framework.

If you are internet accessible, but expect a few users, or are on
a hosted web server, using cgi-bin is a reasonable deployment.

Using a true HTTP server provide tools including: DOS prevention,
throttling, web application firewalls etc. that are worth having
in an internet facing application.

If you are running on an internal intranet, you can use the
stand alone server: roundup-server, but even in this environment,
using a real web server to serve static files and other resources
will perform better.

.. contents::
   :depth: 1
   :local:

You may need to give the web server user permission to access the tracker home
- see the `UNIX environment steps`_ for information. You may also need to
configure your system in some way - see `platform-specific notes`_.

.. index:: pair: web interface; cgi

Web Server cgi-bin
------------------

A benefit of using the cgi-bin approach is that it's the easiest way to
restrict access to your tracker to only use HTTPS. Access will be slower
than through the `stand-alone web server`_ though.

If your Python isn't installed as "python" then you'll need to edit
the ``roundup.cgi`` script to fix the first line.

.. index:: windows; IIS cgi installation

If you're using IIS on a Windows platform, you'll need to run this command
for the cgi to work (it turns on the PATH_INFO cgi variable)::

    adsutil.vbs set w3svc/AllowPathInfoForScriptMappings TRUE

The ``adsutil.vbs`` file can be found in either ``c:\inetpub\adminscripts``
or ``c:\winnt\system32\inetsrv\adminsamples\`` or
``c:\winnt\system32\inetsrv\adminscripts\`` depending on your installation.

See:

   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/web-dev-reference/server-variables

More information about ISS setup may be found at:

   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/

Copy the ``share/roundup/cgi-bin/roundup-cgi``
(``frontends/roundup.cgi`` in source tree) file to your web
server's ``cgi-bin`` directory. You will need to configure it to
tell it where your tracker home is. You can do this either:

Through an environment variable
  Set the variable TRACKER_HOMES to be a colon (":") separated list of
  name=home pairs (if you're using apache, the SetEnv directive can do this)

Directly in the ``roundup.cgi`` file itself
  Add your instance to the TRACKER_HOMES variable as ``'name': 'home'``

The "name" part of the configuration will appear in the URL and identifies the
tracker (so you may have more than one tracker per cgi-bin script). Make sure
there are no spaces or other illegal characters in it (to be safe, stick to
letters and numbers). The "name" forms part of the URL that appears in the
tracker config "tracker :: web" variable, so make sure they match. The "home"
part of the configuration is the tracker home directory.

If you're using Apache, you can use an additional trick to hide the
``.cgi`` extension of the cgi script. Place the ``roundup.cgi`` script
wherever you want it to be, rename it to just ``roundup``, and add a
couple lines to your Apache configuration::

 <Location /path/to/roundup>
   SetHandler cgi-script
 </Location>


CGI-bin for Limited-Access Hosting
----------------------------------

If you are running in a shared-hosting environment or otherwise don't have
permission to edit the system web server's configuration, but can create a
``.htaccess`` file then you may be able to use this approach.

1. Install flup_
2. Create a script ``roundup_stub`` in your server's ``cgi-bin`` directory
   containing::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # if necessary modify the Python path to include the place you
    # installed Roundup
    #import sys
    #sys.path.append('...')

    # cgitb is needed for debugging in browser only
    #import cgitb
    #cgitb.enable()

    # obtain the WSGI request dispatcher
    from roundup.cgi.wsgi_handler import RequestDispatcher
    tracker_home = '/path/to/tracker/home'
    app = RequestDispatcher(tracker_home)

    from flup.server.cgi import WSGIServer
    WSGIServer(app).run()

3. Modify or created the ``.htaccess`` file in the desired (sub-)domain
   directory to contain::

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$      /cgi-bin/roundup_stub/$1 [L]

Now loading the (sub-)domain in a browser should load the tracker web
interface. If you get a "500" error then enable the "cgitb" lines in the
stub to get some debugging information.

.. index:: pair: web interface; stand alone server

Stand-alone Web Server
----------------------

This approach will give you faster response than cgi-bin. You may
investigate using ProxyPass or similar configuration in apache to have your
tracker accessed through the same URL as other systems.

The stand alone serveris used by the Docker image.

The stand-alone web server is started with the command ``roundup-server``. It
has several options - display them with ``roundup-server -h``.

The tracker home configuration is similar to the cgi-bin - you may either edit
the script to change the TRACKER_HOMES variable or you may supply the
name=home values on the command-line after all the other options.

To make the server run in the background, use the "-d" option, specifying the
name of a file to write the server process id (pid) to.


.. index:: pair: web interface; Zope

Zope Product - ZRoundup
-----------------------

ZRoundup installs as a regular Zope product. Copy the
``share/roundup/frontends/ZRoundup`` (frontends/ZRoundup in the
source tree) directory to your Products directory either in
INSTANCE_HOME/Products or the Zope code tree lib/python/Products.

When you next (re)start up Zope, you will be able to add a ZRoundup object
that interfaces to your new tracker.

Apache HTTP Server with mod_wsgi
--------------------------------

This is a work in progress thanks to Garth Jensen.

See the main web site for `mod_wsgi`_ which include directions for
using mod_wsgi-express which is easier if you are not used to apache
configuration. Also there is the
`main mod_wsgi  <https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/>`_ for more
detailed directions.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

These notes were developed on a Microsoft Azure VM running Ubuntu
18.04 LTS.  The instructions below assume:

-  python and roundup are already installed
-  roundup is running in the system python instance (e.g. no virtual
   environment)
-  the tracker ``mytracker`` is installed in the ``trackers`` folder of
   home directory of a user called ``admin``. Thus, the absolute path to
   the tracker home directory is ``/home/admin/trackers/mytracker``.
-  the server has a static public IP address of 198.51.100.25

Install mod-wsgi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install/build it using the python package manager pip, or
install using the OS package manager (apt).

Pip install of mod_wsgi
'''''''''''''''''''''''

This is the tested method, and offers an easier path to get started,
but it does mean that you will need to keep up to date with any
security or other issues. If you use the packages supplied by your OS
vendor, you may get more timely updates and notifications.

The mod_wsgi docs talk about two installation methods: (1) the
so-called CMMI method or (2) with pip. The pip method also provides an
admin script called ``mod_wsgi-express`` that can start up a
standalone instance of Apache directly from the command line with an
auto generated configuration. These instructions follow the pip
method.


1. The `mod_wsgi`_ PyPi page lists prerequisites for various types of
   systems. For Ubuntu, they are apache2 and apache2-dev. To see
   installed apache packages, you can use ``dpkg -l | grep apache``.
   If apache2 or apache2-dev are not installed, they install them
   with:

   - ``sudo apt update``
   - ``sudo apt install apache2 apache2-dev``

2. If ``pip`` is not already installed, install it with
   ``sudo apt install python-pip``

   If you are using python 3, use ``sudo apt-install python3-pip`` and
   change references to pip in the directions to pip3.
3. ``sudo pip install mod_wsgi``. In my case, I got warnings about
   the user not owning directories, but it said it completed
   "successfully."
4. For testing, open port 8000 for TCP on the server. For an Azure VM,
   this is done with Azure Portal under ``Networking`` > ``Add inbound port``
   rule.
5. Test with ``mod_wsgi-express start-server``. This should serve
   up content on localhost port 8000. You can then direct a browser on
   the server itself to ``http://localhost:8000/`` or on another machine at
   the server's domain name or ip address followed by colon then 8000
   (e.g. ``http://198.51.100.25:8000/``). If successful, you should see a
   Malt Whiskey image.

Package manager install of mod_wsgi
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

On debian (which should work for Ubuntu), install apache2 with
libapache2-mod-wsgi:

   -  ``sudo apt update``
   -  ``sudo apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi``

this is the less tested method for installing mod_wsgi and may not
install mod_wsgi-express, which is used below. However there is an
example apache config included as part of `WSGI Variations`_ that can
be used to hand craft an apache config.

You should make sure that the version you install is 3.5 or newer due
to security issues in older releases.

Configure web interface via wsgi_handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In the tracker's home directory create a ``wsgi.py`` file with the
   following content (substituting ``/home/admin/trackers/mytracker``
   with the absolute path for your tracker's home directory):

   .. code:: python

       from roundup.cgi.wsgi_handler import RequestDispatcher
       tracker_home = '/home/admin/trackers/mytracker'
       application = RequestDispatcher(tracker_home)

To run the tracker on Port 8000 as a foreground process
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

1. Change the ``tracker.web`` url in ``config.ini`` to port 8000 at the
   server domain name or ip address (e.g. ``http://198.51.100.25:8000/``).
2. Open port 8000 for TCP on the server if you didn't already do so.
3. ``cd`` to your tracker home directory, then run
   ``mod_wsgi-express start-server wsgi.py``.
4. Test by directing a browser on another machine to the url you set
   ``tracker.web`` to in ``config.ini``.

Run tracker as background daemon
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To run the tracker on Port 80 or as a background process, you'll need
to configure a UNIX group with appropriate privileges as described in
`UNIX environment steps`_. These steps are summarized here:

1. To add a group named "mytrackergrp" run: ``sudo groupadd mytrackergrp``.
2. Add the owner of the tracker home (admin in this example) run:
   ``sudo usermod -a -G mytrackergrp admin``
3. Add user that runs Apache (the default on Ubuntu is www-data) run:
   ``sudo usermod -a -G mytrackergrp www-data``
4. Add user mail service runs as (e.g. daemon) run:
   ``sudo usermod -a -G mytrackergrp daemon``
5. Change group of the database in the tracker folder run:
   ``sudo chgrp -R mytrackergrp ~/trackers/mytracker``.
6. Make sure group can write to the database, and any new files created
   in the database will be owned by the group run:
   ``sudo chmod -R g+sw ~/trackers/mytracker/db``

To run mod_wsgi on PORT 80
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

1. Change the ``tracker.web`` url in ``config.ini`` to the server url
   with no port designator. E.g. ``http://198.51.100.25``.
2. Open port 80 on the server for TCP traffic if it isn't open already.
3. Stop the system instance of Apache to make sure it isn't holding on
   to port 80 run: ``sudo service apache2 stop``.

To run as a foreground process
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. From the tracker home directory, run
   ``sudo mod_wsgi-express start-server wsgi.py --port 80 --user admin --group mytrackergrp``

To run as a background process
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. From the tracker home directory, bash
   ``sudo mod_wsgi-express setup-server wsgi.py --port=80 --user admin --group mytrackergrp --server-root=/etc/mod_wsgi-express-80``
2. Then, run ``sudo /etc/mod_wsgi-express-80/apachectl start``
3. To stop, run ``sudo /etc/mod_wsgi-express-80/apachectl stop``

.. index:: triple: web interface; apache; mod_python (depricated)

Apache HTTP Server with mod_python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of roundup 2.0, mod_python support is deprecated. The apache.py
file is still available, but may be limited to working for Python 2
only. Using mod_wsgi with Apache is the recommended way to deploy
roundup under apache.

`Mod_python`_ is an `Apache`_ module that embeds the Python interpreter
within the server.  Running Roundup this way is much faster than all
above options and, like `web server cgi-bin`_, allows you to use HTTPS
protocol.  The drawback is that this setup is more complicated.

The following instructions were tested on apache 2.0 with mod_python 3.1.
If you are using older versions, your mileage may vary.

Mod_python uses OS threads.  If your apache was built without threads
(quite commonly), you must load the threading library to run mod_python.
This is done by setting ``LD_PRELOAD`` to your threading library path
in apache ``envvars`` file.  Example for gentoo linux (``envvars`` file
is located in ``/usr/lib/apache2/build/``)::

  LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libpthread.so.0
  export LD_PRELOAD

Example for FreeBSD (``envvars`` is in ``/usr/local/sbin/``)::

  LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libc_r.so
  export LD_PRELOAD

Next, you have to add Roundup trackers configuration to apache config.
Roundup apache interface uses the following options specified with
``PythonOption`` directives:

TrackerHome:
  defines the tracker home directory - the directory that was specified
  when you did ``roundup-admin init``.  This option is required.

TrackerLanguage:
  defines web user interface language.  mod_python applications do not
  receive OS environment variables in the same way as command-line
  programs, so the language cannot be selected by setting commonly
  used variables like ``LANG`` or ``LC_ALL``.  ``TrackerLanguage``
  value has the same syntax as values of these environment variables.
  This option may be omitted.

TrackerDebug:
  run the tracker in debug mode.  Setting this option to ``yes`` or
  ``true`` has the same effect as running ``roundup-server -t debug``:
  the database schema and used html templates are rebuilt for each
  HTTP request.  Values ``no`` or ``false`` mean that all html
  templates for the tracker are compiled and the database schema is
  checked once at startup.  This is the default behaviour.

TrackerTiming:
  has nearly the same effect as environment variable ``CGI_SHOW_TIMING``
  for standalone roundup server.  The difference is that setting this
  option to ``no`` or ``false`` disables timings display.  Value
  ``comment`` writes request handling times in html comment, and
  any other non-empty value makes timing report visible.  By default,
  timing display is disabled.

In the following example we have two trackers set up in
``/var/db/roundup/support`` and ``/var/db/roundup/devel`` and accessed
as ``https://my.host/roundup/support/`` and ``https://my.host/roundup/devel/``
respectively (provided Apache has been set up for SSL of course).
Having them share same parent directory allows us to
reduce the number of configuration directives.  Support tracker has
russian user interface.  The other tracker (devel) has english user
interface (default).

Static files from ``html`` directory are served by apache itself - this
is quicker and generally more robust than doing that from python.
Everything else is aliased to dummy (non-existing) ``py`` file,
which is handled by mod_python and our roundup module.

Example mod_python configuration::

    #################################################
    # Roundup Issue tracker
    #################################################
    # enable Python optimizations (like 'python -O')
    PythonOptimize On
    # let apache handle static files from 'html' directories
    AliasMatch /roundup/(.+)/@@file/(.*) /var/db/roundup/$1/html/$2
    # everything else is handled by roundup web UI
    AliasMatch /roundup/([^/]+)/(?!@@file/)(.*) /var/db/roundup/$1/dummy.py/$2
    # roundup requires a slash after tracker name - add it if missing
    RedirectMatch permanent ^/roundup/([^/]+)$ /roundup/$1/
    # common settings for all roundup trackers
    <Directory /var/db/roundup/*>
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
      AllowOverride None
      Options None
      AddHandler python-program .py
      PythonHandler roundup.cgi.apache
      # uncomment the following line to see tracebacks in the browser
      # (note that *some* tracebacks will be displayed anyway)
      #PythonDebug On
    </Directory>
    # roundup tracker homes
    <Directory /var/db/roundup/support>
      PythonOption TrackerHome /var/db/roundup/support
      PythonOption TrackerLanguage ru
    </Directory>
    <Directory /var/db/roundup/devel>
      PythonOption TrackerHome /var/db/roundup/devel
    </Directory>

Notice that the ``/var/db/roundup`` path shown above refers to the directory
in which the tracker homes are stored. The actual value will thus depend on
your system.

.. index:: windows; apache config

On Windows the corresponding lines will look similar to these::

    AliasMatch /roundup/(.+)/@@file/(.*) C:/DATA/roundup/$1/html/$2
    AliasMatch /roundup/([^/]+)/(?!@@file/)(.*) C:/DATA/roundup/$1/dummy.py/$2
    <Directory C:/DATA/roundup/*>
    <Directory C:/DATA/roundup/support>
    <Directory C:/DATA/roundup/devel>

In this example the directory hosting all of the tracker homes is
``C:\DATA\roundup``. (Notice that you must use forward slashes in paths
inside the httpd.conf file!)

The URL for accessing these trackers then become:
``http://<roundupserver>/roundup/support/`` and
``http://<roundupserver>/roundup/devel/``

Note that in order to use https connections you must set up Apache for secure
serving with SSL.

Nginx HTTP Server
-----------------

This configuration uses Gunicorn to run Roundup behind an Nginx proxy.
The proxy also compresses the data using gzip. The url for the tracker
in config.ini should be ``https://tracker.example.org``.

.. code:: 

    user nginx;
    worker_processes auto;
    worker_rlimit_nofile 10000;

	}
      }
    }


FastCGI (Cherokee, Hiawatha, lighttpd)
--------------------------------------

The Hiawatha and lighttpd web servers can run Roundup using FastCGI.
Cherokee can run FastCGI but it also supports wsgi directly using a
wsgi server like uWSGI, Gnuicorn etc.

To run Roundup using FastCGI, the flup_ package can be used under
Python 2 and Python 3. We don't have a detailed config for this, but
the basic idea can be found at:
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying/fastcgi/

If you have deployed Roundup using FastCGI and flup we welcome example
configuration files and instructions.

.. _flup: https://pypi.org/project/flup/

WSGI Variations
---------------

.. index:: triple: web interface; apache; mod_wsgi
   single: wsgi; apache

Apache Alternate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method from Thomas Arendsen Hein goes into a bit more detail and
is designed to allow you to run multiple roundup trackers each under
their own user.

The tracker instances are read-only to the tracker user and located
under /srv/roundup/.  The (writable) data files are stored in the home
directory of the user running the tracker.

To install roundup, download and unpack a distribution tarball and run
the following as user "roundup"::

  python setup.py build_doc
  python setup.py sdist --manifest-only
  python setup.py install --home="/home/roundup/install" --force

Create a user roundup-foo, group roundup-foo to run the tracker.  Add
the following apache config to
/etc/apache2/sites-available/roundup-foo (under debian/Ubunutu, modify
as needed):

.. code:: ApacheConf

    ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log

    LogLevel notice

    DocumentRoot /var/www/

    <VirtualHost *:80>
            CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log vhost_combined

            # allow access to roundup docs
            Alias /doc/ /home/roundup/install/share/doc/roundup/html/

            # make apache serve static assets like css rather than
            # having roundup serve the files
            Alias /foo/@@file/ /srv/roundup/foo/html/

            # make /foo into /foo/
            RedirectMatch permanent ^/(foo)$ /$1/

            # start a wsgi daemon process running as user roundup-foo
            # in group roundup-foo. This also changes directory to
            # ~roundup-foo before it starts roundup.wsgi.
            WSGIDaemonProcess roundup-foo display-name=roundup-foo user=roundup-foo group=roundup-foo threads=25

            # make tracker available at /foo and tie it into the
            # wsgi script below.
            WSGIScriptAlias /foo /srv/roundup/foo/roundup.wsgi
            <Location /foo>
                    WSGIProcessGroup roundup-foo
            </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

The directory ~roundup-foo should have:

   * a ``db`` subdirectory where messages and files will be stored
   * a symbolic link called ``instance`` to /srv/roundup/foo which has
     been initialised using ``roundup-admin``.

The `Apache HTTP Server with mod_wsgi`_ section above has a simple
WSGI handler.  This is an enhanced version to be put into
``/srv/roundup/foo/roundup.wsgi``.

.. code:: python

    import sys, os
    sys.stdout = sys.stderr

    enabled = True

    if enabled:
        # Add the directory with the roundup installation
        # subdirectory to the python path.
        sys.path.insert(0, '/home/roundup/install/lib/python')

        # obtain the WSGI request dispatcher
        from roundup.cgi.wsgi_handler import RequestDispatcher

        tracker_home = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'instance')
        application = RequestDispatcher(tracker_home)
    else:
        def application(environ, start_response):
            status = '503 Service Unavailable'
            output = 'service is down for maintenance'
            response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain'),
                                ('Content-Length', str(len(output)))]
            start_response(status, response_headers)
            return [output]

This handler allows you to temporarily disable the tracker by setting
"enabled = False", apache will automatically detect the changed
roundup.wsgi file and reload it.

One last change is needed. In the tracker's config.ini change the db
parameter in the [main] section to be /home/roundup-foo/db. This will
put the files and messages in the db directory for the user.

.. index:: pair: web interface; Gunicorn
   single: wsgi; Gunicorn

Gunicorn Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run with Gunicorn use ``pip install gunicorn``. This configuration
uses a front end web server like nginx, hiawatha, or apache configured as
a reverse proxy. See your web server's documentation on how to set it
up as a reverse proxy.

The file wsgi.py (obtained from ``frontends/wsgi.py``) should be in
the current directory with the contents::

  # if roundup is not installed on the default PYTHONPATH
  # set it here with:
  import sys
  sys.path.append('/path/to/roundup/install/directory')

  # obtain the WSGI request dispatcher
  from roundup.cgi.wsgi_handler import RequestDispatcher
  tracker_home = '/path/to/tracker/install/directory'

  app =  RequestDispatcher(tracker_home)

Assuming the proxy forwards /tracker, run Gunicorn as::

  SCRIPT_NAME=/tracker gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:8917 --timeout=10 wsgi:app

this runs roundup at port 8917 on the loopback interface. You should
configure the reverse proxy to talk to 127.0.0.1 at port 8917.
If you want you can use a unix domain socket instead. Example:
``--bind unix:///var/run/roundup/tracker.sock`` would be used for the
nginx configuration below.

If you are customizing a docker continer to use gunicorn, see
https://pythonspeed.com/articles/gunicorn-in-docker/.

.. index:: pair: web interface; uWSGI
   single: wsgi; uWSGI

uWSGI Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a basic roundup install using uWSGI behind a front end server,
install uwsgi and the python3 (or python) plugin. Then run::

   uwsgi --http-socket 127.0.0.1:8917 \
       --plugin python3 --mount=/tracker=wsgi.py \
       --manage-script-name --callable app

using the same wsgi.py as was used for Gunicorn. If you get path not
found errors, check the mount option. The /tracker entry must match
the path used for the [tracker] web value in the tracker's config.ini.

Configure an Email Interface
============================

If you don't want to use the email component of Roundup, then remove the
"``nosyreaction.py``" module from your tracker "``detectors``" directory.

See `platform-specific notes`_ for steps that may be needed on your system.

There are five supported ways to get emailed issues into the
Roundup tracker.  You should pick ONE of the following, all
of which will continue my example setup from above:

As a mail alias pipe process
----------------------------

Set up a mail alias called "issue_tracker" as (include the quote marks):
"``|/usr/bin/python /usr/bin/roundup-mailgw <tracker_home>``"
(substitute ``/usr/bin`` for wherever roundup-mailgw is installed).

In some installations (e.g. RedHat Linux and Fedora Core) you'll need to
set up smrsh so sendmail will accept the pipe command. In that case,
symlink ``/etc/smrsh/roundup-mailgw`` to "``/usr/bin/roundup-mailgw``"
and change the command to::

    |roundup-mailgw /opt/roundup/trackers/support

To test the mail gateway on unix systems, try::

    echo test |mail -s '[issue] test' support@YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE

Be careful that some mail systems (postfix for example) will impose
limits on processes they spawn. In particular postfix can set a file
size limit that is inherited by the mailgw. If the database files
(anydbm, sqlite) exceed this limit, *this can cause your Roundup
database to become corrupted.*


As a custom router/transport using a pipe process (Exim4 specific)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The following configuration snippets for `Exim 4`_ configuration
implement a custom router & transport to accomplish mail delivery to
roundup-mailgw. A configuration for Exim3 is similar but not
included, since Exim3 is considered obsolete.

.. _Exim 4: https://www.exim.org/

This configuration is similar to the previous section, in that it uses
a pipe process. However, there are advantages to using a custom
router/transport process, if you are using Exim.

* This avoids privilege escalation, since otherwise the pipe process
  will run as the mail user, typically mail. The transport can be
  configured to run as the user appropriate for the task at hand. In the
  transport described in this section, Exim4 runs as the unprivileged
  user ``roundup``.

* Separate configuration is not required for each tracker
  instance. When a email arrives at the server, Exim passes it through
  the defined routers. The roundup_router looks for a match with one of
  the roundup directories, and if there is one it is passed to the
  roundup_transport, which uses the pipe process described in the
  previous section (`As a mail alias pipe process`_).

The matching is done in the line::

  require_files = /usr/bin/roundup-mailgw:ROUNDUP_HOME/$local_part/schema.py

The following configuration has been tested on Debian Sarge with
Exim4.

.. note::
  The Debian Exim4 packages don't allow pipes in alias files
  by default, so the method described in the section `As a mail alias
  pipe process`_ will not work with the default configuration. However,
  the method described in this section does. See the discussion in
  ``/usr/share/doc/exim4-config/README.system_aliases`` on any Debian
  system with Exim4 installed.

  For more Debian-specific information, see suggested addition to
  README.Debian in
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=343283, which will
  hopefully be merged into the Debian package eventually.

This config makes a few assumptions:

* That the mail address corresponding to the tracker instance has the
  same name as the directory of the tracker instance, i.e. the mail
  interface address corresponding to a Roundup instance called
  ``/var/lib/roundup/trackers/mytracker`` is ``mytracker@your.host``.

* That (at least) all the db subdirectories of all the tracker
  instances (ie. ``/var/lib/roundup/trackers/*/db``) are owned by the same
  user, in this case, 'roundup'.

* That if the ``schema.py`` file exists, then the tracker is ready for
  use. Another option is to use the ``config.ini`` file (this changed
  in 0.8 from ``config.py``).

Macros for Roundup router/transport. Should be placed in the macros
section of the Exim4 config::

  # Home dir for your Roundup installation
  ROUNDUP_HOME=/var/lib/roundup/trackers

  # User and group for Roundup.
  ROUNDUP_USER=roundup
  ROUNDUP_GROUP=roundup

Custom router for Roundup. This will (probably) work if placed at the
beginning of the router section of the Exim4 config::

  roundup_router:
      driver = accept
      # The config file config.ini seems like a more natural choice, but the
      # file config.py was replaced by config.ini in 0.8, and schema.py needs
      # to be present too.
      require_files = /usr/bin/roundup-mailgw:ROUNDUP_HOME/$local_part/schema.py
      transport = roundup_transport

Custom transport for Roundup. This will (probably) work if placed at
the beginning of the router section of the Exim4 config::

  roundup_transport:
      driver = pipe
      command = /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/roundup-mailgw ROUNDUP_HOME/$local_part/
      current_directory = ROUNDUP_HOME
      home_directory = ROUNDUP_HOME
      user = ROUNDUP_USER
      group = ROUNDUP_GROUP

As a regular job using a mailbox source
---------------------------------------

Set ``roundup-mailgw`` up to run every 10 minutes or so. For example
(substitute ``/usr/bin`` for wherever roundup-mailgw is installed)::

  0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /usr/bin/roundup-mailgw /opt/roundup/trackers/support mailbox <mail_spool_file>

Where the ``mail_spool_file`` argument is the location of the roundup submission
user's mail spool. On most systems, the spool for a user "issue_tracker"
will be "``/var/mail/issue_tracker``".

As a regular job using a POP source
-----------------------------------

To retrieve from a POP mailbox, use a *cron* entry similar to the mailbox
one (substitute ``/usr/bin`` for wherever roundup-mailgw is
installed)::

  0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /usr/bin/roundup-mailgw /opt/roundup/trackers/support pop <pop_spec>

where pop_spec is "``username:password@server``" that specifies the roundup
submission user's POP account name, password and server.

apop (authenticated) and pops (pop over ssl) methods are also
supported. See `the section on mailgw in the admin guide
<admin_guide.html#mail-gateway-script-command-line>`_.

On windows, you would set up the command `using the windows scheduler`_.

As a regular job using an IMAP source
-------------------------------------

To retrieve from an IMAP mailbox, use a *cron* entry similar to the
POP one (substitute ``/usr/bin`` for wherever roundup-mailgw is
installed)::

  0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /usr/bin/roundup-mailgw /opt/roundup/trackers/support imap <imap_spec>

where imap_spec is "``username:password@server``" that specifies the roundup
submission user's IMAP account name, password and server. You may
optionally include a mailbox to use other than the default ``INBOX`` with::

  imap username:password@server mailbox

If you have a secure (ie. HTTPS) IMAP server then you may use
``imaps`` in place of ``imap`` in the command to use a securnae
connection.  To use imap with CRAM or OAUTH, see `the section on
mailgw in the admin guide
<admin_guide.html#mail-gateway-script-command-line>`_ .

As with the POP job, on windows, you would set up the command
`using the windows scheduler`_.


UNIX Environment Steps
======================

Each tracker ideally should have its own UNIX group, so create
a UNIX group (edit ``/etc/group`` or your appropriate NIS map if
you're using NIS).  To continue with my examples so far, I would
create the UNIX group 'support', although the name of the UNIX
group does not have to be the same as the tracker name.  To this
'support' group I then add all of the UNIX usernames who will be
working with this Roundup tracker.  In addition to 'real' users,
the Roundup email gateway will need to have permissions to this
area as well, so add the user your mail service runs as to the
group (typically "mail" or "daemon").  The UNIX group might then
look like::

     support:*:1002:jblaine,samh,geezer,mail

If you intend to use the web interface (as most people do), you
should also add the username your web server runs as to the group.
My group now looks like this::

     support:*:1002:jblaine,samh,geezer,mail,apache

The tracker "db" directory should be chmod'ed g+sw so that the group can
write to the database, and any new files created in the database will be owned
by the group.

If you're using the mysql or postgresql backend then you'll need to ensure
that the tracker user has appropriate permissions to create/modify the
database. If you're using roundup.cgi, the apache user needs permissions
to modify the database.  Alternatively, explicitly specify a database login
in ``rdbms`` -> ``user`` and ``password`` in ``config.ini``.

An alternative to the above is to create a new user who has the sole
responsibility of running roundup. This user:

1. runs the CGI interface daemon
2. runs regular polls for email
3. runs regular checks (using cron) to ensure the daemon is up
4. optionally has no login password so that nobody but the "root" user
   may actually login and play with the roundup setup.

If you're using a Linux system (e.g. Fedora Core) with SELinux enabled,
you will need to ensure that the db directory has a context that
permits the web server to modify and create files. If you're using the
mysql or postgresql backend you may also need to update your policy to
allow the web server to access the database socket.


Public Tracker Considerations
=============================

If you run a public tracker, you will eventually have to think about
dealing with spam entered through both the web and mail interfaces.

See the section on `Preventing SPAM`_ in the
`customisation documentation`_ that has a simple detector
that will block lot of spam attempts.

Also you can consider adding `reCaptcha to reduce bot logins as
described on the wiki
<https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/RequireReCAPTCHAForLogin>`_. The
wiki also documents how to add `multi-factor (MFA)/one time
keys/password using TOTP/HOTP
<https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/OneTimePasswords>`_. If you
have a single sign on system see: the `wiki page on using Shibboleth
<https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/ShibbolethLogin>`_
or `LDAP <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/LDAPLogin2_1_5_1>`_
with Roundup. More customisation can be found under the
Security headings of the `CustomisationExamples wiki page
<https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/CustomisationExamples>`_ and
`AdminstrationExample
<https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/AdministrationExample>`_ pages
on the wiki.


Docker Support
==============

If you don't want to install Roundup on a host, you can create a
Docker container or use the `pre-built container on
hub.docker.com
<https://hub.docker.com/r/rounduptracker/roundup>`_. Docker hub
images support `multiple tags <#tags-for-dockerhub-docker-images>`_.
Docker images run Roundup using the `stand-alone web
server`_ method. The image only supports http. We suggest putting an
https terminating proxy in front of it.

This is a work in progress and patches to improve it are welcome. You
can find the docker config files under the `scripts/Docker` directory
of the source tree.

The Roundup container uses the 64 bit Alpine Python distribution.
It includes database drivers for anydbm, SQLite, MySQL and
Postgresql (Postgresql is untested). It also includes additional
libraries that are listed in `scripts/Docker/requirements.txt`
(including redis client support).

Email support is a work in progress. Outgoing email to an external
SMTP server should work. Receiving email should work by using a
scheduled (cron) job to access email:

* `As a regular job using a mailbox source`_
* `As a regular job using a POP source`_
* `As a regular job using an IMAP source`_

However running cron in a container is problematic (running
busybox crond as root vs. non-root, requiring setgrp privs
etc).

Using the host's crontab with a command like::

   docker exec roundup-tracker roundup-mailgw tracker \
         mailbox /var/spool/mail/roundup

might be a solution if you can mount a mail spool directory or use
pop/imap. Patches for implementing better email support are welcome.

If you want to use a MySQL backend, see `Docker-compose 
Deployment`_ to deploy a Roundup container and a MySQL container
backend for use with Roundup.

We recommend you follow the `OSWAP Docker Security practices`_ for your
production Roundup instance.

.. _OSWAP Docker Security practices:
   https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html

Building a Docker Container
---------------------------

You can build a docker container in one of 4 modes defined by the
``source`` build-arg.

``--build-arg="source=local"``
  the default if no source is defined. Build using the version in
  the source tree by running ``setup.py install``.

``--build-arg="source=pypi"``
  build the newest production release version deployed to pypi.
  If you want to build using a pre-release, you can append 
  `pip version specifiers
  <https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#version-specifiers>`_ to
  `pypi` without embedding any spaces. For example::

     # install 2.2.0 if available or 2.2.0b1 or 2.2.0b2 etc.
     --build-arg="source=pypi~=2.2.0b1"

     # install only a 2.2.0 beta
     --build-arg="source=pypi~=2.2.0b1,!=2.2.0"

  Note that versions of Roundup before 2.2 may not run correctly
  in a Docker container.

``--build-arg="source=pip_local"``
  Build using the version in the source tree by running ``pip
  install``. This places some files (e.g. man pages, templates) in
  different directories from the `local` install but is preferred
  by some Python users.

``--build-arg="source=pip_sdist"``
  Disabled - hopefully it will be available in the future.
  This is meant for maintainer/developer use. It installs using
  pip from a source distribution (sdist) tarball built by
  following the RELEASE.txt. It is meant for testing
  releases or building a docker image that installs a new pending
  source distribution release. Normal users/admins should not use it.
  Use ``local`` or ``pip_local`` instead.

Build a docker container using the code in the current directory,
with this build command from the top of the source tree::

     docker build -t roundup-app -f scripts/Docker/Dockerfile .

Build a container using the newest production (non pre-release)
Roundup release on PyPI, by running::

     docker build -t roundup-app --build-arg="source=pypi" \
          -f scripts/Docker/Dockerfile .

Change the ``build-arg`` for building in other modes.

The Dockerfile declares a single volume mounted at
``/usr/src/app/tracker`` inside the container. You will mount
your tracker home directory at this location. The
``/usr/src/app`` path can be changed by adding::

  --build-arg="appdir=/new/path"

You can also add additional modules to the docker container by
using::

  --build-arg="pip_mod=requests setproctitle"

Because of deficiencies in the docker program (see:
https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/29110#issuecomment-1100676306),
there is no way to determine the version of Python inside the
container and make that available as part of the build process. If
your build fails because the ``pythonversion does not match``, add the
suggested ``--build-arg`` to the ``docker build`` command line.

.. _UID at image build time:

By default the container runs Roundup using UID 1000. By setting
``--build-arg="roundup_uid=2000"`` you can change the UID and
GID.

Configuring Roundup in the Container
------------------------------------

.. caution::

  Docker modifies iptables firewall rules. This allows access to the
  container from your local network. `See the official documentation
  for details
  <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish>`_.
  UFW rules are known to be be ignored (see:
  https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/4737).  Use ``-p
  127.0.0.1:ext_port:container_port`` in your docker run commands or
  implement suggestions like: https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker.

Once the docker image is created using one of the build commands
above, run an interactive session with::

    docker run -it --rm -p 127.0.0.1:9017:8080 \
       -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker roundup-app:latest

The ``-v`` option maps a directory from the host into the docker
container. Note that uid 1000 is used by roundup by default. The uid
of the directory (and all files under it) must match the uid. You can
set the `UID at image build time`_. This
example assumes your tracker configs are in the tracker
subdirectory. Replace ``$PWD/tracker`` with the full path name to the
directory where the tracker home(s) are to be stored.

The ``-p`` option maps an external port (9017) to proxy the roundup
server running at port 8080 to the outside. Note if you remove
``127.0.0.1:`` from the -p argument, *any host* on the network will be
able to access the tracker at port 9017.

If the tracker directory is empty, the docker container will prompt
you to `install a tracker template`_ (step 3) and prompt you for the
database type.

.. _install a tracker template: #configuring-your-first-tracker

Then you need to configure the tracker by editing
``template/config.ini``.  Make sure that the tracker web setting ends
in ``/issues/`` See `Configuring your first tracker`_ and the top of
``config.ini`` for other settings.

Once you have configured the tracker, run another interactive session
to `initialise the tracker`_ (step 4) with::

    docker run -it --rm -p 127.0.0.1:9017:8080 \
         -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker roundup-app:latest

this will initialise the database and attempt to start the server.  If
that is successful, use control-c to exit the server.

.. _initialise the tracker: #configuring-your-first-tracker

Now start the server non-interactively (note no `-it` option) with::

    docker run -p 9017:8080 -d \
       -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker roundup-app:latest

Your tracker will be available at: ``http://yourhost:9017/issues/``.

If you need to access your container while the server is running you
can use::

   docker exec -it c0d5 sh

where ``c0d5`` is the id prefix for the running container obtained
from ``docker container ls``.

You should place a web server in front of Roundup (in reverse proxy
mode) for production use. See the proxy_pass example below:

   * `Nginx HTTP Server`_

You can expose the port directly to your intranet by removing ``127.0.0.1``
from the ``-p`` option. See `Stand-alone Web Server`_ for more details.


Running Your Container
----------------------

.. note::
  The examples below use the locally built docker container
  specification: ``roundup-app``. You can replace it with the
  docker hub specification ``rounduptracker/roundup:latest``
  (provided latest is newer than 2.3.0).

As of version 2.3.0 the Docker container has multiple entry points.

Guided install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, running::

    docker run -it --rm -p 127.0.0.1:9017:8080 \
       -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker roundup-app:latest

3 times will install, initialize and serve a Roundup tracker at
``..../issues/`` using ``$PWD/tracker`` as the tracker home. This is the
"guided install" method described in `Configuring Roundup in the
Container`_.

Arguments for roundup-server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have initialized your tracker, any arguments placed at the
end of the ``docker run`` command are passed to the ``roundup-server``.
These arguments **replace** the default arguments of ``issues=tracker``.

Brief Help
~~~~~~~~~~

You can get help running the docker image::

    docker run -it \
        -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker \
        roundup-app:latest help

Invoking a Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can invoke a shell inside the container without exec'ing into the
container using::

    docker run -it \
        -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker \
        roundup-app:latest shell

Then you can manually configure your tracker using ``roundup-admin -i
tracker`` using the directions for `Configuring your first tracker`_.
This is also how you would access tools like ``roundup-gettext`` which
do not have direct entry points like ``admin`` for ``roundup-admin``
and ``demo`` for ``roundup-demo``.

Invoke roundup-admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run ``roundup-admin`` directly by using::

    docker run -it \
        -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker \
        roundup-app:latest admin -i tracker/tracker1

to start ``roundup-admin`` using the directory
``$PWD/tracker/tracker1``. This is one way to create multiple trackers
in subdirectories. It is no different from starting a shell and
invoking ``roundup-admin`` manually.

One possibly useful command is::


    docker run -it \
        -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker \
        roundup-app:latest admin templates

to list description of all the installed templates.

Invoke roundup-demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lastly you can::

    docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8917:8080 \
        -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker \
        roundup-app:latest demo anydbm responsive

to create a directory ``$PWD/tracker/demo`` and autoconfigure a server
using the anydbm backend based on the responsive tracker template.
See `demo mode using docker`_ for steps to change the server port.

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

If you add ``-e SHELL_DEBUG=1`` to the docker command, it sets the
``SHELL_DEBUG`` environment variable which will enable debugging
output from the startup script.

Running Multiple Trackers
--------------------------

If you want to run multiple trackers, create a subdirectory for each
tracker home under the volume mount point (``$PWD/tracker``). Then
invoke ``docker run`` passing the roundup-server tracker
specifications like::

    docker run --rm -p 9017:8080 \
        -v /.../issue.tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker \
        roundup-app:latest tracker1=tracker/tracker1_home \
          tracker2=tracker/tracker2_home

This will set up two trackers that can be reached at
``http://yourhost:9017/tracker1/`` and
``http://yourhost:9017/tracker2/``.  The arguments after
``roundup-app:latest`` are arguments including tracker paths that are
passed to ``roundup-server``.

Docker-compose Deployment
-------------------------

If you want to run using the mysql backend, you can use docker-compose
with ``scripts/Docker/docker-compose.yml``. This will run Roundup and
MySQL in containers. Directions for building using docker-compose are
at the top of the yml file.

Tags for Dockerhub Docker Images
--------------------------------

The docker images available from
https://hub.docker.com/r/rounduptracker/roundup are tagged with:
version-build, version, and ``latest`` tags.  Only production
releases (not pre-releases) are tagged this way. For example, the
tags when 2.3.0 is released will be:

``rounduptracker/roundup:latest``
   is a moving tag that tracks the latest build with the newest
   production version of Roundup using the current newest Alpine
   release with the versions of Python packages at the time of
   the build.

``rounduptracker/roundup:2.3.0``
   is a moving tag that tracks the latest build
   of version 2.3.0 of Roundup. The Roundup software in this
   build will match the 2.3.0 version released on PyPi, but the
   underlying Alpine image or versions of the supporting Python
   libraries (redis, xapian, psycopg2, ...) will change.

``rounduptracker/roundup:2.3.0-1``
   is a static tag and marks the first build of the version
   2.3.0 docker image. When a new release of the image is done,
   it will get the tag ``2.3.0-2`` etc. This is an alternative to
   pulling using a sha256 sum. However it is possible to
   overwrite this image/tag. So it **does not** provide the same
   security guarantees that using a sha256 sum does.

In addition to the release tags, there may be one or more
development tags available. All tags will include `devel`. For
example: ``rounduptracker/roundup:2.3.0b1-devel``,
``rounduptracker/roundup:devel``

You should not assume that any ``devel`` tag is static. They are
mainly for use by Roundup developers/maintainers/testers for
testing. There may be alternate tags ending with ``-devel`` to
indicate builds from specific Mercurial versions/hashes. Also the
tag may be overwritten to change the underlying Python libraries
or images. Unless you like the bleeding edge, these should
**not** be used in production.

Maintenance
===========

Read the `Tasks section of the administration guide
<admin_guide.html#tasks>`_ for information about how to perform
common maintenance tasks on Roundup.


Upgrading
=========

Read the separate `upgrading document`_, which describes the steps needed to
upgrade existing tracker trackers for each version of Roundup that is
released.


Further Reading
===============

If you intend to use Roundup with anything other than the default
templates, if you would like to hack on Roundup, or if you would
like implementation details, you should read `Customising
Roundup`_ and the `Roundup reference`_.


Running Multiple Trackers
=========================

Things to think about before you jump off the deep end and install
multiple trackers, which involve additional URLs, user databases, email
addresses, databases to back up, etc.

1. Do you want a tracker per product you sell/support? You can just add
   a new property to your issues called Product, and filter by that. See
   the customisation example `adding a new field to the classic schema`_.
2. Do you want to track internal software development issues and customer
   support issues separately? You can just set up an additional "issue"
   class called "cust_issues" in the same tracker, mimicing the normal
   "issue" class, but with different properties. See the customisation
   example `tracking different types of issues`_.


Platform-Specific Notes
=======================


Windows
-------

.. index:: windows; choose non-default session/otk database

Configure session database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the session and one time key (OTK) databases default to
using anydbm as the session store. Because GNU dbm and Ndbm are
available on Linux, this is a reasonable default. However Windows
doesn't have compiled libraries for these databases. So it defaults to
"dumb" dbm which is written in Python and is slow. So we recommend
using `some other backend for your session database`_. SQLite or Redis
can be used if you don't want to run a separate supported RDBMS
database server.

.. index:: windows; add Roundup to path

Windows command-line tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make the command-line tools accessible in Windows, you need to update
the "Path" environment variable in the Registry via a dialog box.

On Windows 2000 and later:

1) Press the "Start" button.
2) Choose "Settings"
3) Choose "Control Panel"
4) Choose "System"
5) Choose "Advanced"
6) Choose "Environmental Variables"
7) Add: "<dir>\Scripts" to the "Path" environmental variable.

Where <dir> in 7) is the root directory (e.g., ``C:\Python27\Scripts``)
of your Python installation.

I understand that in XP, 2) above is not needed as "Control
Panel" is directly accessible from "Start".

I do not believe this is possible to do in previous versions of Windows.

Use pip to install pyreadline3 for roundup-admin line editing


If you install pyreadline3_ using pip, roundup-admin will support
command line editing and history.

This will remove the dreaded::

warning when starting roundup-admin.

Windows Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To have the Roundup web server start up when your machine boots up, there
are two different methods, the scheduler and installing the service.

.. index:: windows; use scheduler for email integration

.. _Using the Windows scheduler:

1. Using the Windows scheduler
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Set up the following in Scheduled Tasks (note, the following is for a
cygwin setup):

Run
  ``c:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe -c "roundup-server TheProject=/opt/roundup/trackers/support"``

Start In
  ``C:\cygwin\opt\roundup\bin``

Schedule
  At System Startup

To have the Roundup mail gateway run periodically to poll a POP email address,
set up the following in Scheduled Tasks:

Run
  ``c:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe -c "roundup-mailgw /opt/roundup/trackers/support pop roundup:roundup@mail-server"``

Start In
  ``C:\cygwin\opt\roundup\bin``

Schedule
  Every 10 minutes from 5:00AM for 24 hours every day

  Stop the task if it runs for 8 minutes


.. index:: windows; setup Roundup a service

2. Installing the roundup server as a Windows service
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This is more Windows oriented and will make the Roundup server run as
soon as the PC starts up without any need for a login or such. It will
also be available in the normal Windows Administrative Tools.

For this you need first to create a service ini file containing the
relevant settings.

1. It is created if you execute the following command from within the
   scripts directory (notice the use of backslashes)::

     roundup-server -S -C <trackersdir>\server.ini -n <servername> -p 8080 -l <trackersdir>\trackerlog.log software=<trackersdir>\Software

   where the item ``<trackersdir>`` is replaced with the physical directory
   that hosts all of your trackers. The ``<servername>`` item is the name
   of your roundup server PC, such as w2003srv or similar.

2. Next open the now created file ``C:\DATA\roundup\server.ini`` file
   (if your ``<trackersdir>`` is ``C:\DATA\roundup``).
   Check the entries for correctness, especially this one::

    [trackers]
    software = C:\DATA\Roundup\Software

   (this is an example where the tracker is named software and its home is
   ``C:\DATA\Roundup\Software``)

3. Next give the commands that actually installs and starts the service::

    roundup-server -C C:\DATA\Roundup\server.ini -c install
    roundup-server -c start

4. Finally open the AdministrativeTools/Services applet and locate the
   Roundup service entry. Open its properties and change it to start
   automatically instead of manually.

If you are using Apache as the webserver you might want to use it with
mod_python instead to serve out Roundup. In that case see the mod_python
instructions above for details.

Linux
-----

Make sure you read the instructions under `UNIX environment steps`_.

Sendmail smrsh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use Sendmail's ``smrsh`` mechanism, you will need to tell
smrsh that roundup-mailgw is a valid/trusted mail handler
before it will work.

This is usually done via the following 2 steps:

1. make a symlink in ``/etc/smrsh`` called ``roundup-mailgw``
   which points to the full path of your actual ``roundup-mailgw``
   script.

2. change your alias to ``"|roundup-mailgw <tracker_home>"``



Solaris
-------

You'll need to build Python.

Make sure you read the instructions under `UNIX environment steps`_.


Problems? Testing your Python...
================================

.. note::
   The ``run_tests.py`` script is not packaged in Roundup's source
   distribution anymore. You should install:

   * pytest,
   * requests, and
   * mock

   using your distributions package manger or using pip/pip2/pip3 to
   install pytest etc. for your Python version. See the
   `administration guide`_ for details.

   Remember to have a database user 'rounduptest' prepared (with
   password 'rounduptest'). This user
   must have at least the rights to create and drop databases.
   Documentation: details on `adding MySQL users`_,
   for PostgreSQL you want to call the ``createuser`` command with the
   ``-d`` option to allow database creation.

This can only be done if you `install the source`_ distribution
(steps 1-3) or from a `mercurial checkout
<../code.html#get-sources>`_. It will not work if you used `pip
install` as the test suite is not installed. Once you've unpacked
roundup's source, if you have pytest installed, run ``python -m
pytest test`` in the Roundup source directory and make sure there
are no errors. If there are errors, please let us know!

Note that redis tests uses database 15 of the redis server running on
localhost.The tests verify that the database is empty before the redis
tests start.  If you use a password on your redis database it can be
specified in the ``pytest_redis_pw`` environment variable when you run
the test.
