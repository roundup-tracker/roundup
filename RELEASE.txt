Building Releases
=================

Roundup is a pure Python application with no binary components. This file
describes how to build a source release. To find out how to install
Roundup, read the doc/installation.txt file.

Roundup release checklist:

1.  Run unit tests! They should pass successfully. "./run_tests.py"
2.  Change version in roundup/__init__.py, record date in CHANGES.txt.
3.  Update doc/announcement.txt with new details.
4.  Clean out all *.orig, *.rej, .#* files from the source.
5.  python setup.py clean --all
6.  Edit setup.py to ensure that all information therein (contacts,
    classifiers, etc) is correct.
7.  Rebuild documentation in "share/doc/roundup/html"
    python setup.py build_doc
8.  python setup.py sdist --manifest-only
9.  Check the MANIFEST to make sure that any new files are included. If
    they are not, edit MANIFEST.in to include them. "Documentation" for
    MANIFEST.in may be found in disutils.filelist._parse_template_line.
10. python setup.py sdist
    (if you find sdist a little verbose, add "--quiet" to the end of the
     command)
11. Unpack the new dist file in /tmp then a) run_test.py and b) demo.py
    with all available Python versions.
12. Assuming all is well tag the release in the version-control system.
13. python setup.py bdist_rpm
14. python setup.py bdist_wininst
15. Send doc/announcement.txt to python-announce@python.org and
    roundup-users@lists.sourceforge.net and
    roundup-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

So, those commands in a nice, cut'n'pasteable form::

 find . -name '*.orig' -exec rm {} \;
 find . -name '*.rej' -exec rm {} \;
 find . -name '.#*' -exec rm {} \;
 python setup.py clean --all
 python setup.py build_doc
 python setup.py sdist --manifest-only
 python setup.py sdist --quiet
 python setup.py bdist_rpm
 python setup.py bdist_wininst
 python setup.py register
 python setup.py sdist upload --sign
 python2.5 setup.py bdist_wininst upload --sign

(if the last two fail make sure you're using python2.5+)
Note that python2.6 won't correctly create a bdist_wininst install on
Linux (it will produce a .exe with "linux" in the name). 2.7 still has
this bug (Ralf)
